Confidence is lower amongst supporters of the liberal conservative Moderate party.Writing in Dagens Nyheter, the Institute of Media Studies director Lars Truedson argues \u201ca serious discussion is needed about the attitude of journalists and the media on immigration reporting\u201d.Warning the profession\u2019s credibility is in tatters on the issue, the veteran journalist urged writers and editors to give a more honest picture of how mass migration has affected Sweden.Amongst concerns expressed by Truedson is that journalists are \u201cexcessive\u201d in paying attention to press ethics guidelines not to emphasise a subject\u2019s \u201cethnic origin, nationality, occupation, political affiliation, religious beliefs or sexual orientation\u201d if it is irrelevant to a story.The mainstream media in Sweden has been accused of habitual censorship:\u00a0photographs of migrant criminal suspects are routinely pixelated, with even their skin tones changed, in order to hide the extent of migrant crime.", "dateOfCollection": "2017-05-30T17:08:35Z"}, {"publisher": "breitbart-news", "description": "The Los Angeles Times devoted its front page on Memorial Day to a story about how anxious anti-Trump activists are finding ways to relax.", "title": "L.A.

They know strategy. They know crisis.But five months into the Trump presidency, they\u2019ve never had their endurance so tested.So, in need of relief themselves, they go to a longtime community organizer for help.In his workshops and webinars, Victor Narro tells them to unplug, garden, hike, dance, volunteer, build altars at their cubicles and look at photos that bring them joy. They\u2019re in it for the long haul, after all. President Trump still has nearly 200 more weeks in office.\u2026He teaches them how to slow down and breathe deeply.

Later, the Department of Defense (DOD) announced that as of July 1, 2017, transgender recruits would be accepted into the military. The DOD took these steps even though transgender personnel are likely to need medical, surgical, and psychological care that undermines their readiness for battle by rendering them non-deployable.Acutely aware of the geopolitical problems we face, President Trump announced his intention to restore the strength of our military. Americans appreciated the priorities described by Secretary of Defense James Mattis during his confirmation hearing: mission readiness, command proficiency, and combat effectiveness. Unfortunately, the implementation of President Obama\u2019s transgender policies did not consider the impact that \u201ctransitioning\u201d personnel would have on military readiness and combat effectiveness.The arguments used by the Obama Administration to support its transgender policy changes stemmed from a few politically correct reports produced by well-funded LGBT activist organizations. The first \u201cstudy\u201d was released in August 2013 by the pro-LGBT Williams Institute in partnership with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. The next March, a private, non-governmental \u201cTransgender Military Service Commission,\u201d headed by Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders, released a report through the pro-LGBT think tank, the Palm Center. These two private studies and the various government reports and directives that followed have not focused on how the new transgender policies will affect military readiness and war-fighting effectiveness \u2013 the core function of the armed forces. Nor were these policy changes mandated by the Congress.\u00a0 Rather, they were driven by bureaucratic reinterpretations of existing law. Given the magnitude of these changes, it would seem wise to halt the process and seek congressional guidance and statutory language.In fact, just before the DOD issued the transgender policy change, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services refused to provide national coverage for gender reassignment surgery citing insufficient studies about the health outcomes of such surgeries and small sample sizes in the studies that have been conducted. However, DOD is now requiring taxpayers to foot the bill for gender reassignment surgery, with no benefit to the taxpayer or the military.If implemented as planned, these transgender policies will require our military to assume the risks of recruiting and retaining persons who may require long-term medical treatment. Such procedures and physical changes often produce uncertain results associated with higher rates of depression and suicide. \u201cTransitioning\u201d service members require that the government bear the cost of hormone treatments, surgery, and post-operative care. This creates a tremendous incentive for individuals to join the military in order to receive the costly medical procedures associated with \u201ctransitioning,\u201d since transgender individuals cannot be excluded from joining. And it\u2019s difficult to see how any person undergoing this process would be deployable and combat-ready. What\u2019s more, the time taken away from commanders\u2019 combat-related duties while they take on the responsibilities of medical case workers is significant.\u00a0 It\u2019s unfair to expect them to be judged on their ability to oversee medical-psychological cases like these.We do welcome the Pentagon\u2019s recent nullification of an October 2016 directive imposing \u201copen-door\u201d shower and bathroom guidelines on all DOD schools. But continuing implementation of Obama\u2019s transgender policies ignores the strongly-felt concerns of women who do not want to be exposed to individuals of the opposite sex in facilities which offer minimal privacy.\u00a0 This is a particular problem when the incidence of rape in the military is so severe.I received a letter from a known but confidential source in the naval service who asked me to inform the command structure in Washington about the damaging effects of these policies:As part of the policy, CO\u2019s must facilitate the requests of individuals for transgender treatment (surgery, cross-hormonal therapy, etc.)\u2026.\u00a0 [O]nce the service member is considered \u201cstable\u201d in their preferred gender, and their \u201cgender marker\u201d is changed in a DoD database, they must be accommodated in the berthing and bathroom facilities of their preferred gender regardless of whether they still possess their opposite sex anatomy!\u00a0 (And most are expected to do so).\u00a0 Given the close living quarters that most military members have to share, this is particularly distressing to many of us, especially women.These policies will ultimately undermine recruitment and retention.Secretary Mattis must consider the many complex ramifications of these Obama-era policies that remain in effect. The DOD and the Congress need to ensure the priorities of the U.S. armed forces remain those that the Secretary has outlined:\u00a0 mission readiness, command proficiency, and combat effectiveness.\u00a0 Holdover personnel from the Obama Administration need to focus on these new priorities, and not on the last Administration\u2019s social engineering projects that ignore military readiness.Lt.

One is FISC, and the other is the court that hears appeals from FISC decisions, the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR). The benches of FISC are comprised of federal judges from regular federal trial courts throughout the nation, and three appellate judges from around the nation comprise the bench of FISCR.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) recently declassified an April 26, 2017, ruling from FISC, detailing violations of Fourth Amendment rights during the final year of the Obama administration.The problems dealt specifically with Section 702 of FISA. This provision of federal law, found at 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1881a, contains \u201cminimization\u201d procedures for U.S. citizens whose information is scooped up by the intelligence community while those agencies are conducting FISA surveillance. These safeguards minimize the burden on civil rights caused by the intrusion of the federal government into citizens\u2019 lives.The Fourth Amendment commands:The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.Writing the 99-page opinion for FISC, Judge Rosemary Collyer castigated the Obama administration for failing to follow the Section 702 procedures designed to ensure that the government does not violate Americans\u2019 civil rights as it is performing work that is vitally important to national security. Collyer declared that the previous administration\u2019s cavalier violations of Section 702\u2019s requirements created \u201ca very serious Fourth Amendment issue.\u201dCollyer sharply criticized the National Security Agency\u2019s inspector general and the NSA\u2019s Office of Compliance for Operations for their \u201cinstitutional \u2018lack of candor,\u2019\u201d signaling that in addition to ignoring legal constraints, the Obama administration was not being honest with the court about its violations of federal law.Under President Trump, the NSA decided on March 30 that it would stop certain collection activities that FISC was then reviewing. Collyer noted this change for the better in her opinion, and adding that the court granted \u201capproval of the amended certifications and accompanying targeting and minimization procedures.\u201dThe court also criticized the FBI, faulting the domestic agency with distributing \u201craw FISA information\u201d to a wide array of individuals associated with the bureau, including private contractors who did not need access to the information.\u00a0Collyer noted that this unwarranted practice had also ceased under the Trump administration, with the FBI curtailing its dissemination of raw intelligence on April 18.Parts of the opinion were redacted to safeguard other relevant facts.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Kennedy in Frankfurt, where he told the audience \u201cthose who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future.\u201d\u201cWith change comes insecurity, skepticism \u2026 and, not infrequently, the glorification of the supposedly good old days,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cParticularly in view of the complexity of global contexts, a wish for simple answers spreads. But anyone who puts on national blinkers and has no view of the world around him will ultimately get lost.\u201dHer main challenger in September, the Social Democrats\u2019 candidate Martin Schulz, doubled down on Merkel\u2019s Sunday comments, saying the summits made it clear that Trump was a president \u201cwho wants to humiliate others, who presents himself like an authoritarian ruler.\u201d\u201cEurope is the answer, and stronger cooperation between the European countries at all levels is the answer to Donald Trump,\u201d Schulz said on ARD public television. \u201cAnd above all else, we must not submit to Trump\u2019s arms-race logic.\u201dAnd Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, also a Social Democrat, said Monday that if the Trump administration \u201cfinds pushing through national interests more important than an international order\u2026 then I say that the West has become smaller \u2014 it has at least become weaker.\u201dHe added, however, that he hopes \u201cwe can win back the United States one day, because there are also large parts of American society that we must not forget.\u201dFollowing the G-7 meeting in Sicily on Saturday, Merkel was sharply critical of Trump\u2019s decision not to join the other countries in reiterating support for the 2015 Paris Agreement that aims to slow global warming, calling the G-7 climate talks \u201cvery unsatisfactory.\u201d\u201cHere is a situation where it\u2019s six, seven if you include the EU, against one,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means there are so far no signs whether the United States of America will remain in the Paris agreement or not.\u201dTrump did not hold a news conference after the summit but later tweeted that he would make his \u201cfinal decision\u201d on the Paris accord this week.Germany has also bristled at criticism from Trump over NATO defense spending and the country\u2019s large trade surplus.Still, it would be unlike Merkel just to give up on dealing with Trump, Tempel said.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her in 12 years give up on anything,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s someone who is very sober about the guys with the big agendas and big egos, be it (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, be it (Turkish President Recep Tayyip) Erdogan, be it Trump.\u201d", "dateOfCollection": "2017-05-30T17:08:36Z"}, {"publisher": "breitbart-news", "description": "During his last year in office, Obama nearly doubled the number of juvenile illegal aliens who were given a pathway to permanent residence.", "title": "Obama Nearly Doubled Number of Juvenile Illegal Aliens Given Amnesty, Says Expert", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/05/30/obama-nearly-doubled-number-juvenile-illegal-aliens-given-amnesty-says-expert/", "author": "John Binder", "publishedAt": "2017-05-30T06:40:34Z", "urlToImage": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/04/dreamer.jpg", "article": "Under the EB-4 visa, illegal alien juveniles living in the U.S. can become classified as \u2018Special Immigrant Juveniles\u2019 and petition to receive legal status under the visa program.Subsequently, the program has become a backdoor amnesty, where migrants under the age of 21 can file for the special legal status so long as they claim their parents have either abused, abandoned, or neglected them.\u201cAbout 99 percent of these youngsters are in the nation illegally, but as \u2018juvenile court dependents\u2019 they will get full green card status once approved,\u201d Center for Immigration Studies Fellow David North wrote about the issue in 2016. \u201cThey have to show that they are wards of the juvenile court system and have been abused or neglected by their parents, who, in almost all cases, are also illegal aliens.\u201dEvery year, 10,000 foreign nationals can receive the EB-4 visa, which also includes religious workers, plus Afghan and Iraqi Translators who help the U.S. military and armed forces members.In his last year in office, President Obama almost doubled the number of juveniles given the Special Immigrant Juvenile status, approving 15,101 for the visa, thus creating a backlog. There were 8,700 who were approved in 2015.\u201cThat starts to crowd out other people in that category,\u201d North said, referring to the religious workers and foreign translators who will be pushed into a backlog now because of the overabundance of applications that were approved for the juvenile group.North told Breitbart Texas that the Obama Administration turned the program into a quiet amnesty.As North explained, the Obama administration expanded the definition of \u201cjuvenile\u201d, which ended up filling the system with applications for legal status. Petitions between 2014 and 2015 ballooned from almost 5,800 applicants to 11,500 applicants.\u201cThe word got out,\u201d North said.In the last full three months of his presidency, Obama continued to expand the program, approving more than 4,400 who will now be placed into a backlog and can later receive permanent legal status in the U.S.It remains unclear whether President Trump\u2019s administration will continue the expansion.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

He also notes that the org received a $500,000 contest reward from Microsoft \u2014 even after critics brought up Chase\u2019s past.Samuelsohn did not answer an email asking if it was his idea or an editor\u2019s assignment to veer from his White House beat to cover the loose association between a California-based activist and a New York-based in-law to the President.", "dateOfCollection": "2017-05-30T17:08:36Z"}, {"publisher": "breitbart-news", "description": "Critics have slammed a new teaching aid which tells children that terrorists kill people because they believe they are treated \u201cunfairly\u201d.", "title": "UK Children Taught to 'Respect' Terrorists Who Kill over 'Unfair' Treatment - Breitbart", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/05/30/teaching-terror-children-respect-killers/", "author": "Virginia Hale", "publishedAt": "2017-05-30T10:45:40Z", "urlToImage": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/05/General-Election-Education1.png", "article": "Published just weeks before a suicide bomber attacked a concert in Manchester, killing 22 people including seven children, Talking About Terrorism recommends teachers \u201cinvite children to write a letter to a terrorist\u201d.The book, which contains forewords by NSPCC Chief Executive Peter Wanless and the director of the Jo Cox Foundation, describes terror incidents in which people launch indiscriminate attacks on members of the public as \u201ca type of war\u201d.Terrorists kill people because they think they are being \u201ctreated unfairly and [are] not shown respect\u201d according to the book, which goes on to give examples of \u201cterrorists\u201d it says were on the right side of history, including Nelson Mandela.\u201cThe Suffragettes used violence and were called terrorists \u2026 Today many people think of them as brave women and admire their struggle for the right to vote,\u201d it stated.Published by Brilliant Publications, the book contains a foreword by Jo Cox Foundation director Iona Lawrence which impresses the importance of fostering \u201ctolerance\u201d.Lawrence, who campaigns to bring illegal immigrants living in camps in France into Britain, warns that the world is \u201cwitnessing huge political and cultural shifts \u00a0\u2014 one of these is the rise of extremism\u201d.Stating that \u201cvalues and beliefs are shaped from the youngest age\u201d, the foreword asserts the need for a \u201cfairer, kinder and more tolerant world\u201d, with Lawrence writing: \u201cChildren and young people can and should be equipped with the confidence to stand up for these values.\u201dBut critics have slammed the book, which was written by Alison Jamieson and Jane Flint, as potentially dangerous.Chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, Chris McGovern, said tasking children with writing a letter to terrorists could cause confusion and leave children upset.\u201cThis a crackpot idea based on the misguided notion that primary school children must engage with, and show \u201crespect\u201d for, religious fanatics who are seeking to kill them,\u201d he told the Express.\u201cIt is part of the \u2018British Values\u2019 agenda that is being forced on schools by Ofsted and the educational establishment.\u201cThe primary school classroom is not the place to humanise terrorism by \u2018pretend dialogue\u2019.\u201d", "dateOfCollection": "2017-05-30T17:08:37Z"}, {"publisher": "breitbart-news", "description": "From actor Chris Evans to director Joss Whedon, the Marvel Comics franchise is committing harikari in the most unbecoming way.", "title": "Marvel Abandons Fan Base: Un-American \u2018Captain America\u2019 on 24/7 Anti-Trump Rant", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/05/30/marvel-abandons-fan-base-un-american-captain-america-on-247-anti-trump-rant/", "author": "Thomas D.

These are, however, the very masses that make up the core viewership of Marvel\u2019s superhero movies.\u201cPeople were just so desperate to hear someone say that someone is to blame,\u201d Evans said in a recent interview with Esquire magazine. \u201cThey were just so happy to hear that someone was angry, hear someone say that Washington sucks.\u201d\u201cI feel rage,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel fury.

Spitting in the face of their conservative fan base that is overwhelmingly pro-life, Whedon and Evans, along with other Marvel stars such as Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), fawn over Planned Parenthood while painting abortion foes as backward and unenlightened.\u201cAs most of you know, Planned Parenthood has been under attack for many years now for another service they thankfully offer, providing a safe place for legal abortions,\u201d Johansson said during a Variety luncheon last year. \u201cA woman\u2019s right to choose what to do with her body shouldn\u2019t just be a woman\u2019s rights issue. It\u2019s the year 2016, and this is a human rights issue.\u201dWhedon recently went so far as to produce a short video panegyric to Planned Parenthood, calling America\u2019s largest abortion provider a \u201cbeacon of hope\u201d for the nation, while imagining how horrible life would be without Planned Parenthood to eliminate the unintended consequences of sexual libertinism.Why actors and filmmakers feel an irresistible urge to allow partisan politics to get in the way of their craft is a mystery, but whatever their motives such unrestraint often has consequences.It\u2019s only a matter of time before Marvel\u2019s fan base calls them out for their hypocrisy.
