Putin responded by demanding proof and accusing the United States of interfering in Russia\u2019s internal affairs.The White House, the CIA, the FBI, the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the newspaper's findings, the Post said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-23T15:44:36Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "The breach has now drawn the scrutiny of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, which is exploring the increased reliance on fencing technology at the nation's most secure prison facilities.", "title": "Exclusive: Empty guard towers allowed carjacker to escape maximum security prison", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/23/exclusive-empty-guard-towers-allowed-carjacker-escape-maximum-security-prison/103007494/", "numberOfLinks": 8, "author": "Kevin Johnson", "publishedAt": "2017-06-23T09:17:07Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/01156a4c62938089786622cf005fb8870a907b76/c=0-0-3499-1977&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799990374553701-XXX-CRIME-FAMILIES-ee0610.JPG", "article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In a maximum security federal prison in California, convicted carjacker Guaymar Cabrera Hernandez made a run for it. A key to his brazen escape last month: Five guard towers ringing the perimeter of the compound were not staffed.Turns out, they have been empty for nearly six years.Instead, prison officials at the U.S. Penitentiary Atwater have been relying on three layers of fencing, including an electrified barrier known as a \"lethal fence\" \u2014 which the 26-year-old Guatemalan inmate easily defeated in a run to freedom that passed directly beneath two of the empty towers,\u00a0according to two officials who are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.So alarmed by the breach, the warden staged a video re-enactment of the escape, featuring a correctional officer scaling the same section of the fence. The video\u00a0demonstrated how to avoid tripping\u00a0a potentially lethal jolt of electricity, according to one of the officials who has viewed the tape.The unusual video, recorded shortly after Hernandez was recaptured on\u00a0May 13,\u00a0has since been sent to the Bureau of Prisons headquarters in Washington. Yet the towers at Atwater remain unstaffed, and the only visible security change at the complex was the addition of one vehicle to the existing single-car patrol to roam the\u00a0prison's outside perimeter.The breach has now drawn the scrutiny of the Senate Homeland Security Committee,\u00a0which is exploring the increased reliance on fencing technology\u00a0at the nation's most secure prison facilities \u2014 \u00a0in lieu of tower officers who once represented the last line of defense against escape and other disturbances.\"The committee is looking into the situation at the Atwater prison as well as other prisons around the country,''\u00a0panel spokeswoman Brittni Palke told USA TODAY, adding that the lawmakers\u00a0are\u00a0coordinating their review with the Justice Department's inspector general.The Bureau of Prisons did not dispute the account of Hernandez's escape or the dearth of tower officers,\u00a0saying that the agency \"continues to monitor its physical security structures in order to ensure adequate security procedures are in place.''\"For security reasons, we cannot comment on our use of towers and fencing,'' spokeswoman Tovia Knight said.Yet the breakdown at one of the federal system\u2019s most secure facilities is casting new attention on persistent security concerns and staffing shortages, first disclosed by USA TODAY,\u00a0that for years have plagued the country\u2019s largest prison system.In recent years, nurses and other medical staffers have been thrust into guard duty and other security-related shifts to fill the chronic personnel gaps, despite their lack of experience patrolling the corridors and recreation yards inside the overcrowded system.Despite the problems, the BOP paid more than $2 million in bonuses to top administrators and wardens during the past three years while the agency was confronting security-related staffing shortages, overcrowding, sub-par inmate medical care\u00a0and a lurid sexual harassment lawsuit that engulfed its largest institution, according to government records and court documents.The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is now\u00a0reviewing the bonus payments. But the Atwater breach is prompting the Senate Homeland Security Committee to\u00a0launch\u00a0a \"bureau-wide'' investigation into compromised fencing and other security concerns across the prison\u00a0system.\"Our office is in the process of forming an investigation into bureau-wide issues and would like to use the issues with the fencing at Atwater as a starting point,'' according to committee correspondence obtained by USA TODAY.A committee investigator, in an email\u00a0dated June 13, refers to the panel's interest in obtaining the Atwater video and describes the \"structural flaws of the fences'' as of \"great concern to us.''DeTekion Security Systems, a New York company which has conducted maintenance on fencing at Atwater as recently as March, did not respond to a request for comment.Related:\u00a0The Atwater case is just one high-profile example of how the bureau's emphasis on fencing technology\u00a0has increasingly supplanted dependence on correctional officers, as a concession to both technology and budget constraints.Perimeter towers at the bureau's largest penitentiary in Coleman, Fla., have also been unstaffed for years, said Joe Rojas, president of the local prison workers union.\u00a0The empty towers have long unnerved officers who fear that they represent a glaring security weakness.\"I think everybody would rather have eyes, ears and boots on the ground rather than rely on a fence,'' said Rojas. Members of his union\u00a0are charged with securing more than 2,600 inmates assigned to maximum security units.Hernandez, serving a 115-month sentence for carjacking and assault with intent to commit robbery, was transferred to Atwater following his 2016 attempted escape from a medium security federal prison in West Virginia.At Atwater, federal authorities discovered Hernandez missing about 8:30 p.m., May 12, during checks after the evening meal. According to one official briefed on the incident, the\u00a0inmate with a slight build climbed a rain spout to the roof of a building, where he went undetected before making his way through the fencing.Gouged by concertina wire, Hernandez's blood marked the path that he took, up and eventually over the barriers just below the towers. Hernandez\u00a0managed to scale the electrified fence by using insulators attached to the fence as stair-steps, avoiding the charged wires, the official said.Hernandez also may have slipped past a\u00a0motion sensor just outside the fence-line. It is not immediately clear whether security officials were alerted to a tripped sensor at the time.Beyond the federal prison system, the Hernandez escape raised concerns in the surrounding community of Atwater,\u00a0where Merced County\u00a0Sheriff Vern Warnke said local authorities were not alerted to the breach\u00a0until hours after the inmate was discovered missing.Daryl Allen, a spokesman for the sheriff, said that delay prompted a meeting between Warnke and federal prison authorities shortly after Hernandez was recaptured. Allen said the meeting \"ironed out\" communications problems between the prison and local law enforcement, at least in terms of the delayed notification.Yet the meeting did not apparently address the staffing of the guard towers.\u00a0\"He (the sheriff) has heard they may have some issues,'' Allen said. \"Those are rumors that he has heard.''", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-23T15:44:36Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "Sears Holdings is closing another 20 stores as the distressed department-store chain seeks to stanch the bleeding.", "title": "Sears to close 20 more stores as crisis continues", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/06/23/sears-holdings-kmart-store-closures/422802001/", "numberOfLinks": 8, "author": "Nathan Bomey", "publishedAt": "2017-06-23T14:21:31Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/22ae66fff2977ca0539a2e728ef2e17468b9f001/c=0-49-580-375&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/21/USATODAY/usatsports/searsexterior_hi_large.jpg", "article": "Sears Holdings is closing another 20 stores as the distressed department-store chain seeks to stanch the bleeding amid swirling challenges for the retail sector.The company will shutter 18 Sears stores and two Kmart locations,\u00a0real estate investment trust Seritage Growth Properties confirmed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.The move adds to a steady drip of closures that now add up to more than 260 for the year, leaving the company with more than 1,100 remaining locations.The iconic American department-store chain has buckled under pressure from online competitors, having\u00a0failed to reinvent its brick-and-mortar experience.Sears acknowledged in March that there was \"substantial doubt\" it would survive on its own, though the company said its cost-cutting maneuvers and other retail strategies would greatly improve its chances of carrying on. CEO Eddie Lampert has since blasted critics and said Sears is \"fighting like hell.\"Related:Sears Holdings has already shed $1 billion in costs this year, mostly through stores closures, and raised cash by selling its Craftsman brand to Stanley Black & Decker.The latest round of stores will begin liquidation sales by June 30 and will close by mid-September, Sears said in a statement.\u00a0\"We understand that members may be disappointed when we close a store, but our Shop Your Way membership platform, websites and mobile apps allow us to maintain these valued relationships long after a store closes its doors,\" the company said. \"As a result, we hope to maintain and even grow our relationships with the members who shopped this location.\"Business Insider reported that the list of stores set to close includes three in Ohio, three in New York, two in Texas and two in Maryland. USA TODAY could not immediately confirm those locations.The company was spending about $11.2 million annually in rent on the 20 leases, according to Seritage, which was formed in 2015 in a sale-leaseback deal that provided Sears with financial aid and real-estate flexibility.The company will owe Seritage\u00a0one year of rent plus one year of annual operating expenses as an early termination fee.A Seritage spokesperson declined to comment.Lampert's investment firm owns 43.5% of the limited partnership units of Seritage and controls 7.9% of its voting power.The move was similar to transactions favored by investors in legacy retailers whose real estate is considered more valuable than their actual business.Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-23T15:44:37Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "A camera found at a Goodwill store in Portland, Ore., revealed never-before seen images of\u00a0Mount St. Helens eruption.", "title": "Camera found at Goodwill reveals forgotten photos of Mount St. Helens eruption", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/nation-now/2017/06/23/camera-found-goodwill-reveals-forgotten-photos-mount-st-helens-eruption/422778001/", "numberOfLinks": 9, "author": "Mary Bowerman", "publishedAt": "2017-06-23T15:04:38Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aa5d4c60ce440be71daf98f6d1c85c55190ad801/c=0-22-1021-599&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/636338015971207653-helens051815x005.jpg", "article": "A camera found at a Goodwill store in Portland, Ore., revealed long-forgotten images of the Mount St. Helens eruption.\u00a0Photographer Kati Dimoff told KIRO-TV that she often finds old\u00a0cameras and develops the film she finds inside.

Grigsby had been weeks away from deploying to Iraq when the Army recalled him to Washington. He became the first division commander to be relieved in more than 45 years.In a stinging letter of reprimand, Gen. Daniel\u00a0Allyn, the vice chief of the Army, wrote that the \u201cmanner and frequency\u201d of his communication with the woman compromised the chain of command and created the perception that she was given preferential treatment. Allyn noted that Grigsby had been warned by his top aides about the public appearance of the relationship but continued.\u201cIn doing so, you placed your personal interests above those of the unit as it prepared for combat,\u201d Allyn wrote.Grigsby, in a statement, apologized and said he \u201cvolunteered\u201d to be retired at the lower grade. The Army requires that officers retire at the last grade they served satisfactorily.\"While I am embarrassed and disappointed in myself, I am more deeply troubled by the pain I know that I have caused my family, the First Infantry Division, the United States Army and all those with whom I have served our nation these past 35 years,\u201d Grigsby said in his statement. \u201cTo them, I offer my sincerest apologies.\u201dThe Washington Post first reported Grigsby\u2019s punishment.In September, the Army issued a brief statement in September announcing that Grigsby had been fired from his post leading the \u201cBig Red One.\u201d The division has seen combat some of the America\u2019s bloodiest battlefields from the Argonne Forest in World War I to D-Day in World II to Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.\u00a0Grigsby joins a growing list of rising stars in the military laid low for misconduct in the last year. The Army has stripped ranks from former Lt. Gen. Ron Lewis, the former top military adviser to the Defense secretary, and Maj. Gen. David Haight, who oversaw military operations in Europe, following investigations into personal failings. Lewis lost his job after running up tabs on his government credit card at strip clubs; Haight\u2019s decade-long affair and \u201cswinging lifestyle\u201d cost him his stars.Like Lewis and Haight, Grigsby had enjoyed steady advancement to the upper reaches of Army leadership. A decorated combat veteran, Grigsby commanded Army infantry units from the platoon to division levels. He led troops in war zones from Kosovo to Iraq to Afghanistan. He also commanded the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa, a key counter-terrorism post in Djibouti.Grigsby\u2019s affair halted his ascent and left him in a rare and undesirable club. Maj. Gen. James Baldwin was the last division commander to be relieved after an investigation found him negligent in at attack that left 33 dead and 83 wounded at Fire Support Base Mary Ann in Vietnam on March 28, 1971.\u00a0Read more:\u00a0", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-23T15:44:37Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "Bill Clinton signed a law in 1996 barring immigrants from receiving federal benefits, like food stamps and Medicaid.

And, as he did in past campaign speeches, Trump spoke for a long time and reeled off numerous false and misleading claims:The president visited Iowa on June 21, making an official stop first at Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids to talk about agriculture. Later that evening, Trump spoke to a large crowd in the nearby U.S. Cellular Center at a political rally organized by his campaign.At his rally, Trump exaggerated when he claimed that his administration had deported MS-13 gang members \u201cby the thousands.\u201d It is by the hundreds, not thousands.Trump, June 21: \"The other thing that I have to tell you. You have a gang called MS-13. \u2026 These are true animals. We are moving them out of the country by the thousands, by the thousands.\"Trump is referring to the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, a gang that was formed by Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles in the 1980s. In April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that there are 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. That made us skeptical of the claim that \u201cthousands\u201d already had been deported.We asked the White House how many gang members have been removed under the Trump administration, but it declined to comment.However, The\u00a0Washington Post on May 24 wrote that this year the U.S. has deported 398 gang members to El Salvador \u201ccompared with 534 in all of 2016, according to Salvadoran government statistics.\u201d Those figures represent members of all El Salvador gangs, such as MS-13 and the 18th Street gang. MS-13 is \u201cprimarily El Salvadoran,\u201d according to a 2005 National Gang Threat Assessment report by the National Alliance of Gang Investigators Association, though it\u2019s possible there are members from other countries.Danielle Bennett, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told us in an email that so far in fiscal year 2017 \u2014 from Oct. 1, 2016, to June 4, 2017 \u2014 ICE has removed 2,798 gang members. But that includes all gang members, not just MS-13 members. She said ICE \u201cdoes not track gang removals by specific gang,\u201d so it does not know how many of the 2,798 were MS-13 members. The 2,798 removals also span both the Obama and Trump administrations, so not all of the FY 2017 deportations occurred under Trump.By contrast, there were 2,057 gang members deported in fiscal 2016, so there has been an increase this fiscal year. We don\u2019t know how much of that is attributable to Trump\u2019s policies, but Bennett said that ICE under the Trump administration \u201cdoes specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal.\u201d That appears to be corroborated by the statistics from El Salvador published in the Post.Bennett also said that ICE Homeland Security Investigations has made 602 criminal arrests and 170 administrative immigration arrests of MS-13 members so far in fiscal year 2017, as of June 4. But those figures include arrests made under both administrations, and the criminal arrests include citizens and noncitizens alike. For example, ICE reported last month that it arrested 104 MS-13 gang members as part of a six-week anti-gang enforcement operation that resulted in 1,378 arrests from March 26 to May 6. But nearly two-thirds of all those arrested were U.S. citizens, so most would not have been eligible for deportation.Trump can take credit perhaps for cracking down on gang members and increasing the deportation rate of gang members from El Salvador. But he exaggerates when he says he is deporting MS-13 gang members \u201cby the thousands.\u201dIn the farming state of Iowa, Trump repeatedly played on the mythical claim that the federal estate tax is keeping family farms from being passed on to the next generation of farmers.First, in his speech at Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids, the president said:Trump: \"I want to make sure the next generation of Americans has that opportunity [to live on a farm] as well. And, in particular, that includes your children and your grandchildren, and [we are] working very hard to get rid of the death tax so that those farms can be passed on.\"And at his rally later that evening, he said the estate tax should go because, \u201cYou should have a right to pass your farm onto your children and onto your grandchildren.\u201dThe fact is, however, that more than 99% of all farms are expected to be passed on without paying any estate tax at all. Repeal of the federal estate tax would benefit only the very wealthiest multimillionaires. And even the few who owe any tax may spread payments out over more than a decade.A March 15 study by the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 38,328 farms would become part of estates in 2016, of which only 0.42% \u2014 161 estates \u2014 would owe any estate tax at all.All of those would be multimillion-dollar farms; only estates worth $5.45 million or more must file a return, and most of them don\u2019t owe any tax. For those who do owe tax, the study estimated that the average effective rate would be 20% \u2014 with the option of spreading payments over 14 years.Separate research by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center puts the number even lower. TPC estimates that only 50 farms and closely held businesses will pay any estate tax in 2017.And regardless of whether the number is 161 or 50, those farm estates that owe any tax at all have the option to spread installments over 14 years at reduced interest rates.When we wrote about this estate-tax myth in 2015, we reached out to Neil Harl, an Iowa State University professor of economics and agriculture, who has been studying the estate tax\u2019s impact on small businesses and farms for decades.\u201cI have been involved in this area since 1958 and I have never seen land that had to be sold to pay the federal estate tax and I have conducted more than 3,400 seminars in 43 states which included federal estate tax planning,\u201d Harl wrote to us in an email. The italics were his. And for this article, we checked back with him, and he said that is still the case.\u201cThe lobbyists early on, I am told, concluded farmers as a group are more highly respected than billionaires, at least on this issue,\u201d he added.Trump wrongly claimed that \u201call\u201d insurance companies have left the individual market in Iowa. In fact, Medica Health announced on Monday that it would stay in the market statewide.The president further claimed that insurers are \u201cleaving all of the states.\u201d There are currently 44 counties in three states with no insurer for 2018, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.Trump:\u00a0\"In fact, I was just told by your great governor and ex-governor that your insurance companies have all fled the state of Iowa. Pretty sad, isn\u2019t it? Well, they\u2019re \u2014 I\u2019ll tell you what, they\u2019re going from every state. They\u2019re leaving all of the states.\"Iowa\u2019s individual insurance marketplace \u2014 where those who get Affordable Care Act subsidies buy their own insurance \u2014 has had a shaky outlook for 2018. Before Medica\u2019s announcement on Monday, the state was unsure if the insurance carrier would participate next year. Two other insurers \u2014 Aetna and Wellmark \u2014 had already said they wouldn\u2019t sell plans on the state marketplace in 2018, leaving Medica as potentially the sole statewide insurer. (Gundersen Health Plan sells policies in five of the state\u2019s 99 counties, Iowa\u2019s Insurance Division says.)Iowa\u2019s Insurance Division said it was \u201cunlikely these carriers will remain\u201d in 2018 and proposed on June 12 to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services a \u201cstopgap measure\u201d to retool the state\u2019s ACA marketplace, where 72,000 Iowans now get coverage. That stopgap measure would change the income-based tax credits to age- and income-based assistance; create one plan rather than the metal levels of the ACA (bronze, silver, gold, platinum); and add funding to a state reinsurance program to help insurers cover high-cost individuals.Iowa\u2019s Insurance Division confirmed to FactCheck.org that Medica was the only insurer to file 2018 proposed rates by this week\u2019s deadline; Gundersen did not.Medica\u2019s announcement was widely reported, and it said its 2018 plans would come with a 43% average premium increase. Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen said the state would still move forward with the stopgap proposal, and he expressed concern about Medica\u2019s average rate increase driving away younger and healthier policyholders.Medica CEO John Naylor told CNBC on June 16 that the company wanted certainty from the federal government on whether cost-sharing subsidies for low-income individuals would continue. In late May, the Trump administration and House of Representatives asked for a 90-day delay to the federal lawsuit on the matter, according to Politico.\u201cWhen the federal government set out certain rules, our expectations are that these rules are followed,\u201d Naylor told CNBC. \u201cSo as we look at pricing we need to know are those rules going to be enforced in 2018.\u201dTrump greatly exaggerated when he claimed that insurance companies are \u201cleaving all of the states.\u201d As of June 21, there were 44 counties, with 31,268 insurance enrollees, at risk of having no insurance carrier for 2018, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which relied on state rate filings and media reports. Those counties are in three states: Ohio, Missouri and Washington. However, the analysis notes that the insurer Centene said it would expand its insurance business in several states, including those three, but hasn\u2019t detailed exactly where.\u201cInsurer participation in 2018 will not be finalized until fall of 2017,\u201d KFF says.Trump again claimed he has reversed the trend of coal mining job losses, and misleadingly pointed to the opening of a new coal mine in Western Pennsylvania as evidence that his policies have led to a resurgence in coal mining. Neither of those is true.Trump, June 21:\u00a0\"And we\u2019ve ended the war on clean, beautiful coal. And we\u2019re putting our miners back to work. In fact, you read about it, last week a brand new coal mine just opened in the state of Pennsylvania, first time in decades, decades. We\u2019ve reversed \u2013 and 33,000 mining jobs have been added since my inauguration.\"In fact, there has been an increase of about 1,000 coal mining jobs since January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For some perspective, there has been a total loss of nearly 40,000 coal mining jobs over the last five years.How does Trump get to 33,000? After talking specifically about coal mining, Trump cites a figure for all mining jobs \u2013 including gas, oil, metal ores, coal and nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying. There have been 32,600 total mining jobs added since January. We wrote about this issue once before when EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt tried a similar sleight of hand.As for the grand opening of the Corsa Coal Company\u2019s Acosta Deep Mine near Pittsburgh on June 8, that had nothing to do with Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back coal regulations. As we wrote when Trump made similar boasts earlier this month, development of the Acosta mine began in September, two months before Trump\u2019s election victory.Industry experts also tell us it is not emblematic of a resurgence of coal mining.The Acosta mine produces a particular type of coal that is used to make steel. That\u2019s a bit of a niche market in the coal industry, accounting for just 10% of coal production in the U.S. There has been a surge in demand for this kind of coal because of production problems overseas.However, the vast majority of coal produced in the U.S. is thermal coal, the kind used to generate electricity. Consumption of that kind of coal has declined by nearly 18% between 2012 and 2016, mostly due to the surge in cheaper natural gas production driven by the shale revolution and to competition from renewable energy.Environmental regulations \u2014 which Trump has targeted \u2014 also hurt coal mining, but according to an April report from Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, those regulations were a \u201csignificantly smaller factor\u201d in the shrinking of the coal industry. Industry experts say Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back those regulations might stem the decline in coal consumption, but would not bring coal mining jobs back to levels seen even a few years ago.Trump touted his decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which he said would have been an economic \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for the U.S. The agreement, which took effect last year, was signed by 195 countries and primarily aims to keep warming \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u201d and to pursue \u201cefforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\u201dThe president pushed back at critics who said the pact is nonbinding.\u201cAnd they all say it\u2019s nonbinding,\u201d he said. \u201cLike hell it\u2019s nonbinding. When we get sued by everybody because we thought it was nonbinding, then you can tell me it was nonbinding.\u201dThere are aspects of the agreement that are legally binding. Todd Stern, a former U.S. special envoy for climate change, explained in a press conference shortly before the agreement was reached that countries must submit \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d that outline their emissions targets and report actions taken to meet those targets. But meeting emissions targets wasn\u2019t one of the legal requirements.Stern, Dec. 2, 2015:\u00a0\"We\u2019ve made our position clear all year long that we support an agreement that\u2019s legally binding in many respects, including the elements of accountability of the agreement, the requirement to put forward a target, to do it with information that clarifies it, the obligation to report and be reviewed on your inventories and the actions you\u2019re taking in order to meet your target. Any number of rules and so forth. So a whole number of elements that are legally binding, but not the target itself.\"Stern wrote a May 8 op-ed for The\u00a0Washington Post urging Trump to stay in the Paris Agreement. He said the president should \u201ckeep in mind that \u2014 as much as I would be sorry to see any retrenchment \u2014 countries can adjust their emissions targets downward. The agreement permits it, and I know because I helped negotiate that flexibility.\u201dTrump said he was promoting legislation that would bar new immigrants from receiving welfare for five years, but a 20-year-old law already does that. He introduced his proposal after promising to preserve the \u201csafety net\u201d for people who \u201ctruly need help.\u201dTrump, June 21: \"But others don\u2019t treat us fairly. That\u2019s why I believe the time has come for new immigration rules which say that those seeking admission into our country must be able to support themselves financially and should not use welfare for a period of at least five years. And we\u2019ll be putting in legislation to that effect very shortly.\"But as The Hill\u00a0pointed out, such a law already exists. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, signed into law in 1996 by then-president Bill Clinton, states that immigrants are \u201cnot eligible for any Federal means-tested public benefit for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of the alien\u2019s entry into the United States.\u201d That would include such benefits as food stamps, Medicaid and Social Security.As USA TODAY noted, there are some exceptions in the law for children and pregnant women, refugees, and active duty military or veterans. It\u2019s possible, the story notes, that Trump is seeking to toughen the restrictions, or to eliminate some exceptions. Trump\u2019s proposed FY 2018 budget notes that refugees are exempt from the five-year waiting period, and stresses the need to control the cost of benefits paid to immigrant-headed households. But it offered no details on how that would be accomplished beyond reducing the number of refugees, curbing illegal immigration and increasing merit-based legal immigration.We reached out to Trump\u2019s press office for clarification, but it declined to provide any information on the record.Trump also repeated the claim that the U.S. already has spent $6 trillion in the Middle East since 2001. It hasn\u2019t.Trump, June 21:\u00a0\"After decades of rebuilding foreign nations all over the world, we are now rebuilding our nation. As of a few months ago, our country has spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, wasted. \u2026 We started 16 years ago and it\u2019s in far worse shape than it was 16 years ago by many times over. So, we spent all of this money, all of these lives.\"Actually, the U.S. has spent about $1.7 trillion through fiscal year 2016, which ended Sept. 30, 2016, according to a February report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.During the campaign, Trump made the $6 trillion figure a talking point. For example, in Philadelphia, he gave a speech in which he said, \u201cWe must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered $6 trillion on foreign wars in the Middle East that never end and that we never win and that have made us less safe.\u201dHis campaign at the time cited a Reuters news article about a study that projected the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will cost the U.S. $6 trillion \u201cover the next four decades.\u201d The story said the cost estimate included \u201cfuture commitments, such as the medical and disability claims of U.S. war veterans.\u201dIt may be that the wars eventually will cost the U.S. $6 trillion. However, Trump said the U.S. \u201chas spent $6 trillion\u201d (past tense) as of \u201ca few months ago.\u201d That\u2019s not accurate.Read more:", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-23T15:44:38Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "The song choices are not subjective, but the ranking sure is.", "title": "Ranked: Every 'song of the summer' from the past 20 years", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/06/22/ranked-every-song-summer-past-20-years/103093984/", "numberOfLinks": 10, "author": "Maeve McDermott", "publishedAt": "2017-06-23T15:16:32Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b2f93082c0c78a2388bc8ebb282871ff3716c9a/c=0-29-800-481&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636337195978130966-song-of-summer-composite.png", "article": "Many artists have earned a \"song of the summer,\" but only one track is the best\u00a0(Photo: Getty/PWC/FIlmMagic.)Summertime requires its own soundtrack. And every year, pop stars compete to deliver the \"song of the summer,\" the track that defines the season on the charts and in listeners' memories.Officially, the song of the summer is the track that spends\u00a0the most time atop the Billboard Hot 100\u00a0between\u00a0Memorial Day and Labor Day. The songs on this list weren't chosen by personal tastes; all of the tracks shown below were the top-charting hits on the Hot 100 for their respective summers, objectively, based on charts data. So if a favorite song isn't included below, pick a fight with the Billboard charts, not the list.It's too early in the season to choose this year's song of the summer, though Despacito has dominated the season's charts thus far. In the meantime, we've analyzed the last 20 years worth of songs of summer, identifying the best and worst singles of years past. Some of these songs are still classics today, and would fit perfectly on any beach or cookout playlist. As for some of the other tracks \u2014 what were we thinking?20. Party Rock Anthem, LMFAO feat. Lauren Bennett & GoonRock (2011)After subjecting us\u00a0to hearing \"Every day I'm shufflin'\" on loop for an entire summer, the neon-clad, uncle-nephew duo\u00a0LMFAO\u00a0put listeners out of their misery in 2012, announcing their\u00a0indefinite hiatus.19. I Kissed A Girl, Katy Perry (2008)2008 was a different time,\u00a0before social media grew into a powerful tool fans used to instantly flame\u00a0pop stars for their missteps, and\u00a0I Kissed a Girl's icky queerbaiting likely would've fared worse today against Internet skeptics.18. Bent, Matchbox Twenty (2000)Matchbox Twenty\u00a0make plenty of good songs\u00a0and\u00a0Unwell and 3 a.m. are classics of the \u201890s micro-genre the band inhabited. Unfortunately, Bent isn't their best.17. Fancy, Iggy Azalea feat. Charli XCX (2014)Fancy will be remembered more as the song that introduced Iggy Azalea to the public consciousness, and less for its actual quality.16. Cheerleader, OMI (2015)2015 was a particularly dull year for summertime releases, save for Fetty Wap's Trap Queen, which peaked too early in the year. But according to the listeners that sent Cheerleader to No. 1,\u00a0OMI's breakthrough single was the best of the worst.15. Genie In A Bottle, Christina Aguilera (1999)Xtina is a '90s icon, but nostalgia isn't enough to earn one of her duller hits a higher ranking.14. Promiscuous, Nelly Furtado feat. Timbaland (2006)As mortifying \u00a0as the lyrics of this song can be, Nelly Furtado is as good\u00a0a rapper as Iggy Azalea, if not better, and her Timbaland duet is bizarrely enjoyable.13. California Gurls, Katy Perry feat. Snoop Dogg (2010)12. One Dance, Drake feat. WizKid & Kyla (2016)Drake's dancehall phase produced a string of enjoyable singles. And while\u00a0One Dance may not have been better than Controlla or Too Good with Rihanna, the rapper was on top of the world in 2016,\u00a0which rightfully included a song of the summer.11. I'll Be Missing You, Puff Daddy and Faith Evans feat. 112 (1997)I'll Be Missing You was an elegy for Notorious B.I.G, and thanks to its May release date, one of rap's most depressing hits also became the year's song of the summer. While it's a classic, it maybe doesn't belong on your pool-party playlist.10. I Gotta Feeling, The Black Eyed Peas (2009)Is there another track that has compelled as many secular listeners to scream \"Mazel Tov!\" across the dance floor as the David Guetta-produced\u00a0hit?\u00a0I Gotta Feeling\u00a0isn't a great song, but that doesn't mean it's not iconic.9. We Belong Together, Mariah Carey (2005)Another weirdly emo choice to hit No. 1,\u00a0We Belong Together\u00a0is an essential later-era Mariah Carey hit and well-deserving of its song of the summer title.8. The Boy Is Mine,\u00a0Brandy & Monica (1998)Monica has confirmed in interviews that she and Brandy won't be releasing an updated version of the song, and rightfully so \u2014 it's a '90s R&B classic.7. Call Me Maybe,\u00a0Carly Rae Jepsen (2012)Call Me Maybe is the archetype of the modern song of the summer, an earworm that listeners can't escape, no matter how they try. And yet, we were always glad to hear Call Me Maybe, which launched the career of one of pop's most effervescent stars.6. Confessions Part II, Usher (2004)Both of Usher's songs-of-summer winners\u00a0earned top placement on this list. His Confessions album is a classic, and\u00a0Confessions Part II still has fun with its tortured narrative of infidelity, but the song isn't exactly feel-good summer material.5. U Remind Me, Usher (2001)A wistful summertime classic, Usher's earlier hit gets the nod for being a little more upbeat than Confessions Part II.\u00a04. Umbrella, Rihanna feat. Jay-Z (2007)Rihanna may earn\u00a0her second song of the summer with her current DJ Khaled collaboration,\u00a0Wild Thoughts, but Umbrella,\u00a0which remains her all-time-best collaboration, sets a high bar.3. Blurred Lines, Robin Thicke feat. T.I. and Pharrell (2013)Upon Blurred Lines' release, some listeners were quick to point out the track's less-than-feminist politics. Unfortunately, it's still a great song; so good that it inspired a failed lawsuit from Marvin Gaye's estate for sounding too similar to Marvin's Got to Give It Up.\u00a0At least they chose a summer classic to kinda-plagiarize.2. Hot In Herre, Nelly (2002)Of all the tracks on this list, Hot in Herre is the most inseparable from summer,\u00a0sweaty to the point that it's almost cloying.

His uncle, Steven Avery, also is serving a life term in connection with the killing. Avery also is appealing his conviction.The state appealed Duffin's ruling, putting the case before the federal appeals panel.Thursday's ruling doesn't necessarily mean Dassey will be freed from prison. The state can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court or retry Dassey.\"We are evaluating the 2-1 decision from the court,\" said Johnny Koremenos, director of communications and public affairs for the Wisconsin Department of Justice. \"We anticipate seeking review by the entire 7th Circuit or the United States Supreme Court and hope that today\u2019s erroneous decision will be reversed.\"Dassey's attorneys said the ruling took their client one step closer to freedom.\u201cAs of today, Brendan has been locked up for 4,132 days,\" said one of his attorneys, Laura Nirider. \"For the first time, this decision brings the end of that road in sight. We\u2019re not there yet.\"Nirider stressed that the court\u2019s ruling sent a strong message that the majority of the panel believed in Dassey\u2019s innocence. \u201cThis is a confession that nobody can have any faith in.\u201dRead more:Another of his attorneys, Steven Drizin, said Thursday\u2019s ruling should send a loud message to state district courts and state appeals courts, which initially upheld Dassey\u2019s 2007 murder conviction.\u201cIn evaluating whether a confession is voluntary, courts must engage in the kind of searching and analysis that the federal courts performed, that the state courts did not.\u201dDassey's attorneys are evaluating their next steps to secure his release.The case was the subject of the hit docu-series\u00a0Making a Murderer, a Netflix production that was released in December 2015.Dassey was 16 years old when he was questioned \u2014 and later charged \u2014 in connection with Halbach\u2019s murder.Nirider said during oral arguments before the 7th Circuit in February that there was a \"drumbeat of promises\" from investigators before \"every major admission\" made by Dassey.\"They fed him the answers they were looking for when he didn't give them the information they wanted to hear,\u201d Nirider told the three-judge panel.The state countered that Dassey\u2019s confession was not coerced because the investigators who questioned him never made him any explicit promises.Thursday's majority opinion discussed a \"pattern of suggestive questioning\" throughout the March 1 interrogation of Dassey.The ruling stated that prosecutors' case against Dassey in the original trial rested almost entirely on Dassey's interviews with police and one phone call with his mother \u2014 but no physical evidence.\"There was no physical evidence linking Dassey to the murder of Halbach \u2014 investigators did not find any of Dassey\u2019s DNA or blood on any of the many objects that were mentioned in his confession \u2014 the knives in Avery\u2019s house, gun, handcuffs, bed, RAV4, key or automotive dolly,\" the decision states.The judges said the state appellate court ignored \"many signs\" that Dassey was trying to please investigators and a clear pattern of fact-finding and promises.\"By doing this \u2014 by linking promises to the words that the investigators wanted to hear, or allowing Dassey to avoid confrontation by telling the investigators what they wanted to hear \u2014 the confession became a story crafted by the investigators instead of by Dassey,\" the ruling states.Contributing: John Ferak; follow Andy Thompsonon Twitter: @Thompson_AW; follow Alison Dirr on Twitter: @AlisonDirr", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-23T15:44:39Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "A study found a correlation between some states with legalized recreational marijuana use and the frequency of collision claim reports.\r\nVideo provided by Newsy", "title": "There could be a link between car wrecks and marijuana", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/health/2017/06/23/there-could-link-between-car-wrecks-and-marijuana/103133484/", "numberOfLinks": 1, "author": "Newslook", "publishedAt": "2017-06-23T10:20:16", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8053d91dc9a2258a0283ca7a3f06eb1e3cc2b513/r=x1803&c=3200x1800/https/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201706/2805/29906170001_5481354895001_5481341374001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "article": "", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-23T15:44:42Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "View videos and photo galleries from USA TODAY", "title": "Pres.

There were conflicting claims of responsibility for this attack from different extremist groups.Hours later twin bombings, minutes apart, hit a crowded market in a Shiite-dominated city in Parachinar, the main city in the Kurram tribal region and killed 24 people, mostly minority Shiite Muslims, according to government administrator Zahid Hussain.The bomb attacks come a few days before the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Fitr, which ends the holy month of Ramadan. TV footage showed panicked people rushing to safety following the Parachinar market bombings.Mohammad Amir, an official at a government-run hospital in Parachinar, said they had received 24 dead bodies and more than 20 of the wounded were listed in critical condition.It was unclear who was behind the attack in Parachinar but Sunni militant groups have claimed responsibility for numerous similar attacks in the past.Friday\u2019s car bombing in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province, was powerful enough that it was heard across the city, shattering windows on nearby buildings, said police spokesman Shahzada Farhat.Wasim Beg, a spokesman at a government hospital, said the death toll from the bombing had risen to 11 throughout the morning and some of the wounded remained in critical condition.TV footage showed several badly damaged cars and a road littered with broken glass.Hours after the attack, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a breakaway faction of the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility. Asad Mansoor, the militants\u2019 spokesman, vowed more such attacks as part of the extremist group\u2019s campaign aimed at imposing Islamic laws in the country.Later Friday, the Islamic State group said in a competing claim that it was behind the attack, adding that one of its followers targeted the police post in Quetta, detonating his suicide belt there. It also released a photograph of the alleged attacker, identified as Abu Othman al-Khorasani.The competing claims could not be reconciled.Anwarul Haq Kakar, a spokesman for the provincial government, blamed neighboring India for the blast but offered no evidence to back up the allegation.Pakistan and India routinely trade charges of interference and inciting attacks on one another\u2019s soil.On Thursday, Pakistan said that an Indian naval officer, Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and sabotage, had petitioned for mercy.Jadhav, who Pakistan said had crossed into Baluchistan from neighboring Iran, was arrested in March 2016 and sentenced to death in April.In New Delhi, the Ministry of External Affairs insisted Jadhav was sentenced on \u201cconcocted charges\u201d and expressed doubts about the existence of the petition for mercy. It also reiterated that the proceedings against Jadhav have been shrouded \u201cin opacity.\u201dBaluchistan has long been the scene of a low-level insurgency by Baluch nationalists and separatists, who want a bigger share of the regional resources or outright independence, but also attacks blamed on the Pakistani Taliban and others. Those militant groups include Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, which is considered a close ally of IS, as well as Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, which has taken credit for several previous attacks in Baluchistan and elsewhere and has bases in Pakistan\u2019s tribal regions.\u00a0", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-23T15:44:43Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "The family had argued that St. Croix County, Wis., had taken their land and should pay them just compensation for that loss under the Fifth Amendment.", "title": "Supreme Court rules against Wisconsin family's property rights claim", "url": "http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2017/06/23/u-s-supreme-court-rules-against-wisconsin-cottage-owners/419190001", "numberOfLinks": 2, "author": "Bruce Vielmetti", "publishedAt": "2017-06-23T15:08:07.739+00:00", "urlToImage": "", "article": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday upheld Wisconsin court rulings that the\u00a0owners of a\u00a0family cottage on Lake St. Croix were not entitled to compensation over development regulations that bar the sale of the family's\u00a0adjacent lot as a site for another home.\u00a0The Murrs wanted to sell the lot to finance an upgrade to the cottage their parents built 56 years ago, and argued that\u00a0\u00a0St. Croix County has essentially taken their land through strict shoreline development and conservation rules and should pay just compensation for that loss under the Fifth Amendment.But St. Croix County, and the state, say that the family's two adjacent parcels, taken together, would easily accommodate a modern home, and so they have not really lost any value.

Not after IndyStar Call for Action got involvedAbel, 30, of Loogootee, is believed to be the only person in Indiana to die from PAM, or primary amebic meningoencephalitis. The infection is triggered by the microscopic, water-borne organism Naegleria fowleri, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The amoeba is transferred to victims, the CDC reports, through water entering\u00a0the nose while swimming in warm lakes and rivers.The CDC reports Naegleria fowleri \u201cis commonly found in warm freshwater (e.g. lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil.\u201d But before you freak out, here\u2019s a little more perspective from the CDC:\u201cThe risk of Naegleria fowleri infection is very low. There have been 40 reported infections in the U.S. in the 10 years from 2007 to 2016, despite millions of recreational water exposures each year. By comparison, in the 10 years from 2001 to 2010, there were more than 34,000 drowning deaths in the U.S.\u201dThe 2014 lawsuit alleged the county and parks board were responsible for West Boggs Lake and failed to protect Abel\u00a0and the public from the deadly organism.Abel\u00a0is believed to have been infected while swimming in the 622-acre West Boggs Lake near Loogootee on July 15, 2012. Weather records indicate the day was humid and hot, with a high in the 80s,\u00a0when Abel\u00a0went for the fateful swim at the lake\u2019s public beach.He became ill several days later and died at an Evansville hospital just days after his symptoms, including headaches and nausea, first appeared.The three-judge court of appeals panel ruled the county and parks board did not have \u2014\u00a0so it did not\u00a0breach \u2014\u00a0a duty to protect Abel\u00a0because his fate was not foreseeable. The court ruled that leaves no issue to be decided at trial, effectively dismissing the case.\u201cAlthough the circumstances here were tragic,\u201d Judge Michael P. Barnes wrote in the opinion, \u201cwe conclude that the County, Parks Board and Health Department did not have a duty to Abel. Consequently, the trial court erred when it denied their motions for summary judgment.\u201dAbel\u2019s family has a Facebook page called Waylon Abel-Amoeba Awareness, where they post information about his case and others around the U.S. An update from October says, in part:\u201cWe just want families to be aware and safe when swimming in fresh water. Please use precautions when getting in any fresh water lake. Remember it's 100% preventable.\u201d The post includes two tips: \u201ckeep head above water\u201d and \u201cwear a swim mask or nose clips.\u201dThe CDC reports much is still unknown about who gets infected while swimming and why because there have been so few cases to study. While infection is rare, the only certain way to avoid exposure, the CDC says, is to \"refrain from water-related activities in warm freshwater.\"\u00a0\u00a0Tim Evans is IndyStar\u2019s consumer advocate.
