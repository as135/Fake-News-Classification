But the most curious element of the Otto Warmbier tragedy is why the young student may have been so badly mistreated at the hands of his captors, who some survivors say are strangely cordial to Western prisoners.Consider the case of Matthew Todd Miller, a California man who in 2014 was sentenced to six years of forced labor in North Korea.\u00a0Miller, who was released six months later, says he was actually treated rather well and even was allowed to keep his iPhone and iPad for at least a month. He listened to his digital music while in captivity.\"I was prepared for the torture. But instead of that, I was killed with kindness,\" he said in an interview with NK News.Warmbier, 22, died Monday after coming back to the U.S. in a coma that lasted for 15 months of his North Korean captivity. The New York Times wrote that intelligence reports suggested Warmbier endured beatings, but doctors in the U.S. who examined him last week say his body shows no signs of physical trauma.Miller, who was not much older than Warmbier at the time of his arrest, said he was held in what\u00a0he described as a \u201cguest house\u201d \u2013 the same place where he said fellow American Kenneth Bae was being held.\u00a0\u201cThey would deliver me food. There were other prisoners in the guest house, too. I could hear them unlocking the doors from the outside to deliver them food.\"Bae told reporters and wrote in his book \"Not Forgotten\" that while there were psychological abuses\u00a0\u2014 he was interrogated 15 hours a day and it let up only after he agreed to sign a paper saying he was a terrorist\u00a0\u2014 he was never beaten. He was freed in 2014 and returned to the U.S., along with Miller.\u201cThere seems to be a general attitude of not using physical violence against Americans, although they don\u2019t appear unwilling to use psychological tactics and that sort thing,\u201d Robert R. King, a former State Department special envoy for North Korea human rights issues, told the Times.\u00a0King\u00a0handled Mr. Warmbier\u2019s case until he retired in January.READ MORE:\u201cThis situation with Warmbier is likely something that happened that (North Korea) did not intend,\u201d King said.In most cases, Western prisoners are coveted as political bargaining chips in the North Korean system. Unlike their own citizens, a Westerner is likely to be released someday and bruises or abuses would be detected. But psychological abuse, based on reports from freed captives, appears to be the norm for Western prisoners until they confess. Aijalon Gomes, an American teacher detained in North Korea in 2010 for 213 days, said in a 2015 interview that he was held in a freezing, tiny cell.\"After a wooden door was opened, I was untied and forced into the cement crawl space.\u00a0 It was no bigger than a dog\u2019s house,\" Gomes said in the interview. \"A little while later, an old blanket that looked like carpet underlayment was thrown in.\u00a0And later still, a package of Korean or Chinese snack food was tossed in.\"READ MORE:Merrill E. Newman, an 85-year-old former U.S. Army officer who served in the Korean War, was held by North Korea for 42 days in 2013, accused of war crimes. He spent most of his time in captivity at the Yanggakdo Hotel in Pyongyang, where Swedish consular officials reported that he seemed to be well cared for and was even receiving necessary medications for a heart condition. Newman reported after his release that he had been held in comfortable conditions, although he said his \"confession\" to North Korean authorities was coerced.Not every American has been given a pass on violence in North Korea. In an interview with the South Korean news agency Yonhap, Robert Park, a missionary held in North Korea in 2009, said he was severely beaten by soldiers.Park, from Tucson, Ariz., said women with clubs beat him mercilessly in the genitals.\"I saw the devil in their eyes. They are much worse than people in Nazi Germany,\" Park said.\u00a0The torture went on for days in what Park now believes was an attempt to keep him silent about torture.

Emirates finished atop Skytrax\u2019s World Airline Awards last year, when it took the top spot back from Qatar Airways.This year, Emirates dropped to No. 4, placing behind No. 2 Singapore Airlines and No. 3 All Nippon Airways (ANA). Cathay Pacific rounded out the top five of the ratings, which were announced Tuesday on the sidelines of the biennial Paris Air Show.For Qatar Airways, the award comes as a bright spot\u00a0during what's otherwise been a difficult period for the carrier. The Doha-based airline is one of those affected by a U.S. ban on large carry-on electronics, putting it at a passenger-experience disadvantage against competitors unaffected by the ban.TODAY IN THE SKY:\u00a0Flights through busy Qatar hub may be hit by diplomatic spat in Middle East\u00a0|\u00a0Qatar Airways is world's first airline to get the Airbus A350 (story continues below)\u00a0And a diplomatic spat between Qatar and nearby Middle East nations has forced it to scrap flights to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, among others. Also vexing for Qatar Airways is that those nations have closed off their airspaces to flights from Qatar. That's forced many flights from Doha -- where Qatar Airways operates a major hub -- to take circuitous routings to avoid the restrictions.In North America, Air Canada took the title for \u201cBest Airline in North America.\u201d Overall, the carrier placed 29th in the global ratings.Delta was the top ranked U.S. carrier in the World Airline Awards, placing 32nd overall. Virgin America, which had the highest rating among U.S. carriers in 2016, dropped 18 spots to No. 43. That made it fourth among U.S. carriers in the ratings, trailing Delta, Alaska Airlines (No. 36 globally) and JetBlue (No. 39). Alaska Airlines acquired Virgin America in a deal that closed late last year, kicking off a merger that will eventually have both carriers flying under the Alaska Airlines brand.TODAY IN THE SKY:\u00a0Paris Air Show day 1: A bigger 737, huge Airbus order and the president (story continues below)\u00a0The Skytrax awards are one of several annual consumer-focused rankings covering the airline industry.

It can be an excellent way to pay off your debt. But how will transferring a balance affect your credit score? And of what potential pitfalls should you be aware?It\u2019s impossible to predict exactly how any one financial decision will affect your credit score. We can guess based on what we know about credit-scoring algorithms, and credit score simulators are can\u00a0show you how a particular choice might affect your score. But so many factors influence your score that an exact effect is difficult to predict.With that said, we can look at two areas of your credit score a balance transfer will most likely impact: your credit utilization and new credit inquiries.Your credit utilization, or debt-to-credit ratio, is the second most important piece of your credit score, behind your payment history. It\u2019s essentially a measure of how much you owe versus how much credit you have available.Say, for instance, you owe $1,000 on a card with a $2,000 limit. In this case, your debt-to-credit ratio is 50%. (You can see how your debt is impacting your credit by viewing two of your scores for free on Credit.com.)If you\u2019re approved for a new credit card with a balance transfer offer, you\u2019ll wind up with a higher overall credit limit. This could be a good thing, since it will push your debt-to-credit ratio lower.In the above example, if you\u2019re approved for a new card with a $1,000 limit, your total credit limit will be $3,000. As long as you don\u2019t accrue more debt, your total debt-to-credit ratio will be about 33%. Since that\u2019s better than 50%, your credit score should be fine. Plus, with a lower interest rate, you can presumably pay off the debt quicker. As your debt decreases, so will your debt-to-credit ratio, which means your credit score will climb.A balance transfer\u2019s effect on your credit score isn\u2019t all good. To open a new credit card, the card issuer will pull your credit score, which will most likely add an inquiry to your credit file and cause a small but temporary decrease in your score. The impact won\u2019t likely be large unless you apply for several balance transfer cards at once.A balance transfer card can be good\u00a0in some circumstances, but it has\u00a0potential drawbacks. Here\u2019s what to avoid if you opt for a balance transfer:Taking on More Debt\u00a0If you\u2019re already dealing with credit card debt because of your spending habits, a balance transfer may be the wrong choice. Opening a new credit card gives you access to more credit, and with that access can come the temptation to spend. If you\u2019re likely to reach your credit limits, a balance transfer card may not be for you.Paying Too Much in Balance Transfer FeesMost balance transfer cards come with a one-time fee. This fee may be worth it if it gets you out of paying loads of interest every month. But it might also cost more than you\u2019re willing to pay. Be sure you know what the\u00a0fee is upfront.Maxing Out a Credit CardScoring algorithms like FICO\u2019s look at both your overall credit utilization and your per-card credit utilization. So maxing out a balance transfer card to take full advantage of a low- or no-interest offer may negatively affect your credit score, even if opening the new card decreases your overall debt-to-credit ratio.Is a balance transfer right for you? If transferring a balance helps you save money and pay off debt faster, it\u2019s most likely the right choice. Just be careful if you\u2019re preparing to apply for a larger loan, like a mortgage. Even a small ding at the wrong time can hurt you. Still, transferring a balance and efficiently paying off debt will have great consequences for your credit score over the long term.Image: Geber86Sign up for our Credit Report Card and receive the latest tips & advice from our team of 50+ credit and money experts as well as a FREE Credit Score and action plan.

We hope you find the site and the journalism we produce useful. We wanted to take some time to tell you a bit about ourselves.\n\nOur People\n\r\nThe Credit.com editorial team is staffed by a team of editors and reporters, each with many years of financial reporting experience. We\u2019ve worked for places like the New York Times, American Banker, Frontline, TheStreet.com, Business Insider, ABC News, NBC News, CNBC and many others. We also employ a few freelancers and more than 50 contributors (these are typically subject matter experts from the worlds of finance, academia, politics, business and elsewhere). \n\nOur Reporting\n\r\nWe take great pains to ensure that the articles, video and graphics you see on Credit.com are thoroughly reported and fact-checked. Each story is read by two separate editors, and we adhere to the highest editorial standards. We\u2019re not perfect, however, and if you see something that you think is wrong, please email us at editorial team [at] credit [dot] com, \n\r\nThe Credit.com editorial team is committed to providing our readers and viewers with sound, well-reported and understandable information designed to inform and empower. We won\u2019t tell you what to do. We will, however, do our best to explain the consequences of various actions, thereby arming you with the information you need to make decisions that are in your best interests. We also write about things relating to money and finance we think are interesting and want to share.\n\r\nIn addition to appearing on Credit.com, our articles are syndicated to dozens of other news sites. We have more than 100 partners, including MSN, ABC News, CBS News, Yahoo, Marketwatch, Scripps, Money Magazine and many others. This network operates similarly to the Associated Press or Reuters, except we focus almost exclusively on issues relating to personal finance. These are not advertorial or paid placements, rather we provide these articles to our partners in most cases for free. These relationships create more awareness of Credit.com in general and they result in more traffic to us as well.\n\nOur Business Model\n\r\nCredit.com\u2019s journalism is largely supported by an  e-commerce business model. Rather than rely on revenue from display ad impressions, Credit.com maintains a financial marketplace separate from its editorial pages. When someone navigates to those pages, and applies for a credit card, for example, Credit.com will get paid what is essentially a finder\u2019s fee if that person ends up getting the card. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that our editorial decisions are informed by the products available in our marketplace. The editorial team chooses what to write about and how to write about it independently of the decisions and priorities of the business side of the company. In fact, we maintain a strict and important firewall between the editorial and business departments. Our mission as journalists is to serve the reader, not the advertiser. In that sense, we are no different from any other news organization that is supported by ad revenue.\n\r\nVisitors to Credit.com are also able to register for a free Credit.com account, which gives them access to a tool called The Credit Report Card. This tool provides users with two free credit scores and a breakdown of the information in their Experian credit report, updated twice monthly. Again, this tool is entirely free, and we mention that frequently in our articles, because we think that it\u2019s a good thing for users to have access to data like this. Separate from its educational value, there is also a business angle to the Credit Report Card. Registered users can be matched with products and services for which they are most likely to qualify. In other words, if you register and you find that your credit is less than stellar, Credit.com won\u2019t recommend a high-end platinum credit card that requires an excellent credit score You\u2019d likely get rejected, and that\u2019s no good for you or Credit.com. You\u2019d be no closer to getting a product you need, there\u2019d be a wasted inquiry on your credit report, and Credit.com wouldn\u2019t get paid. These are essentially what are commonly referred to as \"targeted ads\" in the world of the Internet. Despite all of this, however, even if you never apply for any product, the Credit Report Card will remain free, and none of this will impact how the editorial team reports on credit and credit scores.\n\nOur Owners\n\r\nCredit.com is owned by Progrexion Holdings Inc. which is the owner and administrator of a number of business related to credit and credit repair, including CreditRepair.com, and eFolks. In addition, Progrexion also provides services to Lexington Law Firm as a third party provider. Despite being owned by Progrexion, it is not the role of the Credit.com editorial team to advocate the use of the company\u2019s other services. In articles, reporters may mention credit repair as an option, for example, but we\u2019ll also be sure to note the various alternatives to that service. Furthermore, you may see ads for credit repair services on Credit.com, but the editorial team isn\u2019t responsible for the creation or implementation of those ads, anymore than reporters for the New York Times or Washington Post are responsible for the ads on their sites.\n\nYour Stories\n\r\nLastly, much of what we do is informed by our own experiences as well as the experiences of our readers. We want to tell your stories if you\u2019re interested in sharing them. Please email us at story ideas [at] credit [dot] com with ideas or visit us on Facebook or Twitter.\n\r\nThanks for stopping by.\n\r\n- The Credit.com Editorial Team\n", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-20T15:31:30Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "The Minnesota Timberwolves will have a Fitbit patch on their jerseys this season as part of new partnership.", "title": "Timberwolves partner with Fitbit for patch deal", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/twolves/2017/06/20/minnesota-timberwolves-partner-fitbit-patch-deal/411143001/", "numberOfLinks": 3, "author": "Kevin Spain", "publishedAt": "2017-06-20T13:12:44Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee2e2c9204a2353cb11c78c8064f8e66932e8e3a/c=0-2562-3229-4386&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636335101080749203-USP-NBA--Minnesota-Timberwolves-Press-Conference.jpg", "article": "\u00a0When\u00a0NBA owners voted to allow\u00a0teams to add patches to their jerseys for advertisement, it\u00a0opened the door for creative partnerships.The Minnesota Timberwolves announced\u00a0a jersey patch deal\u00a0with Fitbit on Tuesday, and the team hopes the partnership becomes something that players, the team office and even fans will participate in.Fitbit will\u00a0provide the Timberwolves, the Minnesota Lynx and the Iowa Wolves of the G-League access to devices.

Two security guards got out of\u00a0the vehicle.One of the men fired three rounds from a 9mm handgun into Richardson's engine.The\u00a0guards from On Point Security Group, a private company based in Clive, later told police they wanted to stop Richardson to tell him the park was closed and\u00a0his vehicle could have been towed.\u00a0Richardson was arrested by police for\u00a0operating while intoxicated.A Des Moines Police Department spokesman called the shooting questionable, but no\u00a0charges were filed against the shooter.\u00a0\u00a0Police have\u00a0forwarded the case to the Polk County attorney, who will decide whether to file charges.\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't know if we have overzealous mall cops taking matters into their own hands, but all indications are that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re dealing with in this situation,\" said Brad Schroeder, a Des Moines attorney representing Richardson.\u00a0\"And it should scare the heck out of everybody.\"Richardson, of Norwalk, told the Register\u00a0the guards \"tailgated\" his car with their amber lights flashing for about a half mile.\u00a0He said he did not stop because he assumed it was security\u00a0\u2014 and not law enforcement\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\"making sure that I exited the park.\"\u00a0He knew he was approaching a gate that had a sensor to open\u00a0it, so he continued driving.Once guards pulled around him and parked sideways across the road, Richardson said he\u00a0slowed down and stopped.\"All of a sudden I heard the 'boom, boom, boom,'\" he said. \"It was so unexpected.\"Material used to absorb liquid on pavement is seen at the site where Scott Richardson's vehicle was shot at by private security guards hired to patrol Des Moines Water Works Park. His attorney says the markings prove he was stopped when the bullets struck his radiator, leaking fluid.\u00a0(Photo: Special to the Register)Both security guards told police that Richardson\u00a0\"kept coming toward them.\" Peter Berger, an attorney representing On Point, said the guards reported that Richardson was \"driving out of control.\"\u00a0Richardson disputes that he was driving fast or erratically, and said he had come to a complete stop before the shots were fired into his car.\u00a0The police report makes no mention of his driving style.\"That was so unexpected because I hadn't done anything I felt to deserve being shot at,\" he said. \"I guess I didn't assume anybody would be shooting a live round. Something could go terribly wrong, you know?\"Richardson was not injured.\u00a0The bullets struck his radiator, transmission cooler, air conditioning condenser and the heater hose,\u00a0he said. His\u00a0car has been out of commission for five weeks.After shooting his vehicle, Richardson said the security guard pointed a gun in his face and yelled at him to put his hand up. The guard then took him out of his car placed\u00a0him in handcuffs.\u00a0Three bullets, fired by a private security guard hired to patrol Des Moines Water Works Park, struck the front of Scott Richardson's SUV.\u00a0(Photo: Special to the Register)The security guards involved in the incident could not be reached for comment.\u00a0The Register is not naming them because they have not been charged with a crime.But Berger, the attorney representing On Point, said the security guards feared for their lives as Richardson was driving toward them and the locked exit. Plus, Richardson was trespassing in the park after hours, he said.\"The driver of the vehicle was not complying with commands to stop, both when the security vehicle was behind and in front of it. And when the driver of the vehicle posed a significant safety hazard to both security guards and Des Moines Water Works, one of the weapons was discharged as a warning and struck the vehicle,\" Berger said. \"It ultimately got the driver\u2019s attention.\"Des Moines police arrived on scene within minutes of the shooting. The investigation report shows police seized both security guards'\u00a09mm handguns and three spent shell casings.\u00a0Scott Richardson\u00a0(Photo: Special to the Register)A preliminary breath test taken on scene showed Richardson's blood alcohol content at .106. He registered .088 on a\u00a0second breath test taken an hour later. The legal limit to operate a motor vehicle in Iowa is .08.\u00a0Schroeder said his client's level of intoxication \"played no part\" in justifying the security guards' actions. He said Richardson was \"peaceably\" leaving the park when his vehicle was shot.\"Who in their right mind \u2014 when they\u2019re trying to get somebody to leave a place and the person is doing so \u2014 decides that it would be helpful to shoot at them to expedite their departure?\" he said. \"I have no idea what they were hoping to accomplish in shooting at him.\"Sgt. Paul Parizek, spokesman for the Des Moines Police Department, said Richardson was under no obligation to stop for the security guards as they attempted to pull him over.Flashing amber lights, which were used on On Point's vehicle that night, are meant to serve as\u00a0a warning,\u00a0he said. The Iowa State Patrol recommends drivers wait to pull over for emergency vehicles until they reach a public, well-lit area if they \"question whether the person is actually an officer,\" according to a brochure posted on its website.\"Everybody knows what the red and blue lights mean, that it's law enforcement and pull over. I didn't know that the amber light\u00a0was wanting me\u00a0to pull over,\" Richardson said. \"I had a good assumption it was park security, but\u00a0I didn't know that. And I was in the darkest part of the park.\"Parizek said he could not comment on more than the immediate facts and circumstances surrounding the case, but he said state law does allow for shots to be fired when a person believes his or her life is in danger. A motor vehicle could be considered a dangerous weapon under Iowa law.But\u00a0Parizek\u00a0added he's unsure whether this situation warranted that level of force.\u00a0\"It appears there was some questionable tactics involved,\" he said. \"We train to avoid these types of situations. I'm not sure if there would have been a similar outcome if Des Moines police were involved.\"\u00a0Bill Stowe, general manager of Des Moines Water Works, declined to comment on specifics of the shooting incident.\u00a0Water Works Park, 2201 George Flagg Parkway, is owned and maintained by the water utility.\u00a0\"I'm certainly concerned that anyone would try to evade a security officer and potentially run them over,\" Stowe\u00a0said. \"\u00a0... We're always very disappointed when visitors to our park  fail to abide by the reasonable requests of our security staff.\"Des Moines Water Works has contracted with a private security firm for years, but security guards were not armed until 2014.\"We run a water plant, we're not making toothpaste or brick pavers, so certainly there are significant security concerns in making sure our water treatment facility and our processes are\u00a0safe from any intrusions,\" said Stowe, who recommended arming security guards. \"We take our security very seriously.\"The Department of Homeland Security lists\u00a0water systems as\u00a0potential targets for terrorist attacks.It wasn't until 2016 that On Point security guards began patrolling the 1,500-acre\u00a0Water Works Park on the southern edge of downtown. Berger said the patrols were added to monitor \"ongoing vandalism\" at the park.\u00a0Des Moines Water Works has a five-year contract with On Point that pays the company $204,150 a year.\u00a0On Point provides 24/7 armed security at the Fleur Drive plant\u00a0and Water Works Park. It also conducts nightly checks at the utility's Saylorville and Maffitt Reservoir treatment facilities.\u00a0Earlier this year, Water Works added an armed guard at its office, 2201 George Flagg Parkway, where\u00a0there is a customer service counter. That costs an additional $57,000 a year.Both security guards involved in the May 14 incident are licensed\u00a0by the Iowa Department of Public Safety, which issues employee identification cards for private security companies.Two-year licenses are issued to individuals who are at least 18 years old and have not been convicted of a felony,\u00a0aggravated misdemeanor or illegally using, carrying or possessing a dangerous weapon. License holders cannot be addicted to\u00a0drugs or alcohol and should be \u201cof good moral character.\u201dBoth security guards involved in the shooting are still employed by On Point, Berger said.\u00a0Gray's Lake Park, a popular city-owned park, is located directly across Fleur Drive from Water Works Park. The city\u00a0contracts with the Des Moines Police Department to provide security there, said Jen Fletcher, marketing supervisor for the parks department. \u00a0Scott Richardson stands for a portrait at the office of his attorney, Brad Schroeder, on Monday, June 19, 2017.\u00a0(Photo: Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register)Though Richardson was unharmed physically, there are some mental scars to overcome. He has not returned to Water Works Park since the incident.\u00a0\"It was shocking,\" he said. \"It was a traumatic experience to have a gun pointed at me when all I was doing was exiting the park at 20 miles per hour.\"Richardson, a self-described cycling enthusiast, said he commuted by bicycle to work 114 days last year. The 19-mile route sometimes took him through Water Works Park.\u00a0He still commutes by bike today, but said he will likely avoid using Water Works Park trails.\u00a0He is considering filing a civil lawsuit.\u00a0\"Mostly I think about how bad it could have turned out or what could happen worse for the next person,\" he said. \"Something could end much more badly for somebody else.\"", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-20T15:31:43Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "View videos and photo galleries from USA TODAY", "title": "Julia Stiles - I&#39;d like to be in &#39;Fleabag&#39;", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2017/06/20/julia-stiles-i&#39;d-like-&#39;fleabag&#39;/103034022/", "numberOfLinks": 0, "author": null, "publishedAt": null, "urlToImage": null, "article": "", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-20T15:31:47Z"}]
