Mikhail Khmel, the company\u2019s deputy director, told Reuters the ferry is aimed at Chinese tourists seeking to visit Vladivostok by sea.\u2022\u00a0Russian railway\u00a0officials\u00a0in January visited North Korea to discuss upgrades to the Rajin-Hasan railway, which links Russia to the Korean peninsula, according to Russia\u2019s state news agency TASS.\u2022\u00a0Russia and North Korea have reached\u00a0a labor immigration agreement\u00a0to expand a program that already employs 40,000 North Korean\u00a0laborers in Russia\u2019s timber and construction industries, a major source of foreign currency for Kim Jong Un\u2019s government, according to the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai.These moves come despite Russia's signing onto recent sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, which call for reducing trade with North Korea in retaliation for two nuclear detonations\u00a0last year\u00a0and ongoing tests of ballistic missiles that the North says are aimed at developing a nuclear delivery system that can reach\u00a0the U.S. mainland.The Security Council issued a unanimous statement on\u00a0\u00a0May 21 that vowed to impose new sanctions on\u00a0North Korea after it tested yet another long-range missile.Trump is\u00a0pressing China to use its $6.6 billion in annual\u00a0trade with North Korea as leverage\u00a0to crack down on North Korea's weapons development, as China handles 90% of the North's business with the rest of the world. But a larger Russian trade relationship with North Korea could negate some of what China may do, several analysts said.The Russian trade activity fits into Russia's thinking about North Korea,\u00a0said James Brown, an associate professor at Temple University\u2019s Tokyo campus.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to isolate North Korea. They want to enable North Korea to be able to continue to conduct activities with the rest of the world,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey\u2019re against the North Korean nuclear program. ... But the Russians also are more sympathetic toward North Korea.\u201dRussian President Vladimir Putin said on May 1 \u00a0that North Korea's recent missile launch was \"dangerous,\u201d and that Russia is \u201ccategorically against the expansion of the club of nuclear states,\u201d according to Sputnik. But he also appeared to criticize U.S. policy toward North Korea, marked by U.S. military exercises near the Korean peninsula and belligerent threats from both Trump and Kim.\u201cWe need to return to dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stop intimidating it and find ways to solve these problems peacefully,\u201d Putin said.Aircraft sit on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson June 1, 2017, in the western Pacific.

Landers, AP)Putin believes North Korea takes provocative steps,\u00a0\u201cbut that it\u2019s forced to act in that way because of aggressive actions by South Korea and the United States, by having exercises and military drills and sending the aircraft carrier and those type of things,\u201d Brown said.Chinese officials have warned they would consider halting crude oil deliveries to North Korea if it engages in more nuclear or long-range missile tests, according to China\u2019s state-run Huanqiu\u00a0newspaper.Regular oil tanker ship traffic between Russia and North Korea, and the rail line that is being repaired, are evidence that Russia could replace some Chinese oil supplies, but it\u2019s unclear if they could replace all of it, said Anthony Ruggiero, an analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank.\u201cIf the Chinese really crack down, would the Russians be able to completely backfill? I\u2019m not sure that they would,\u201d Ruggiero said.While Chinese coal imports have fallen to multiyear lows since the imposition of new sanctions by the U.N. Security Council, China\u2019s imports of North Korean iron ore rose in April to\u00a0the highest level since August 2014 and 10% higher than\u00a0in March, according to the South China Morning Post.The data on China-North Korea trade is sparse and results in a fuzzy\u00a0picture of the impact of official sanctions, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.North Korean prices for food and fuel have spiked recently, but it\u2019s unclear why, Noland said. He ticked off a number of possible reasons \u2014 that supply is down because of sanctions, or it\u2019s being diverted to the military, the population could be hoarding in fear of a war, or people could be more prosperous and buying more rice.But two things are clear: The North Korean currency, the yuan, has been stable so \u201cwhatever is going on is not having a big effect,\u201d Noland said.And while Russia\u2019s trade with North Korea appears to be rising, at $130 million annually it\u00a0is still tiny\u00a0compared to China\u2019s $6.6 billion in annual trade, Noland said.Even so, Russia could\u00a0cause mischief in North Korea for the U.S. and its northeast Asian allies South Korea and Japan, Noland said. \u201cYes, it is plausible that Russia will try to increase trade to increase its geopolitical influence.\u201d", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-05T15:43:46Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "A wild brawl between fans erupted just feet away from the Cavaliers star after Cleveland fell to the Warriors in Game 2 Sunday night.", "title": "LeBron James pushed out of the way of brawl after Cavs' Game 2 loss", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/06/04/lebron-james-pushed-out-way-brawl-after-cavs-game-2-loss/102506088/", "numberOfLinks": 6, "author": "Martin Rogers", "publishedAt": "2017-06-05T04:08:51Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1c9297d0efefedca9726a13b02baec9344f01d8d/c=56-34-2653-1501&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636322173286341344-USP-NBA-FINALS-CLEVELAND-CAVALIERS-AT-GOLDEN-STAT-91447584.JPG", "article": "OAKLAND \u2013 LeBron James was pushed to safety by teammate J.R.

The Saudis agreed to a lucrative,\u00a0$300 billion arms deal that could have emboldened its leadership, believing the U.S. will support actions against Qatar.Tensions first boiled over two weeks ago with Qatar's\u00a0publication of a story that said Al Thani had called Iran\u00a0\u00a0\u201ca regional and Islamic power that cannot be ignored.\u201d\u00a0Qatar said its state-run news agency and Twitter account were hacked and the story was fake, but state-linked\u00a0media continued to publish the comments. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt blocked access to Al Jazeera and affiliated sites.The United States has close ties to both nations.\u00a0Saudi Arabia is\u00a0the closest U.S. ally in the region, and Qatar is home to al-Udeid Air Base and almost 10,000 U.S. troops. Qatar is no outlier to the West: It\u00a0is scheduled to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a month-long\u00a0international soccer tournament and the world's most popular sports event. It is also the world's biggest producer of liquefied natural gas and shares an underwater field with Iran.Saudi Arabia has the only land border with Qatar, and Qatar's population of more than 2.5 million people is\u00a0fed by supply trucks that roll across the border.Qatar's\u00a0Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the measures unjustified and \"based on baseless\u00a0and unfounded allegations.\" Qatar has relentlessly denied claims supporting militant groups in the region. But the country has drawn a cool reception by other Sunni nations for its support of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Qatar also is a primary financial backer in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas. Hamas is considered a terrorist group by the U.S. and several other countries.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking at a news conference in Australia, said there has been a \"growing list of some irritants\" in the region in recent months.\"Obviously they have now bubbled up to a level that countries decided they needed to take action in an effort to have those differences addressed,\" Tillerson said. \"We certainly would encourage the parties to sit down together and address these differences, and we \u2014\u00a0if there\u2019s any role that we can play in terms of helping them address those\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we think it is important that the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) remains unified.\"Contributing: The Associated Press", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-05T15:43:47Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "CNN host Reza Aslan found himself at the center of a media firestorm after a foul-mouthed response to President Trump\u2019s latest call for a travel ban.", "title": "CNN host Rezla Aslan gets flak for potty-mouthed anti-Trump tweet", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/06/05/cnn-host-rezla-aslan-gets-flak-anti-trump-tweet/369922001/", "numberOfLinks": 8, "author": "Matthew Diebel", "publishedAt": "2017-06-05T14:03:39Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68858ef22832d60c8040974347533a8e0631ff0d/c=0-142-850-622&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636322505902197225-REZAXXX-ASLAN-ZEALOT-BOOKS-2626.jpg", "article": "Maybe it was the human brains he ate a couple of years back.CNN host and author Reza Aslan.\u00a0(Photo: Malin Fezehai)Controversial CNN host Reza Aslan found himself at the center of a media firestorm on at the weekend when he responded with a potty-mouthed epithet to President Trump\u2019s tweet reiterating his call for a travel ban.Aslan, host of the CNN series Believer \u2013 in one episode of which he joined a Hindu sect in eating part of a human brain \u2013 later apologized for the Trump-related tweet, saying he \u201clost my cool and responded to him in a derogatory fashion.\u201dAslan had ranted that \u201cThis piece of s--- is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency.

Often the attackers are native-born ISIS sympathizers who act on their own.May had called the election in hopes that her party would win a larger majority as she begins complex \u2014 and potentially costly \u2014 negotiations to exit\u00a0the European Union. However, recent polls show her once-commanding lead over Corbyn has narrowed sharply,\u00a0as he focused the election on the Conservatives'\u00a0cuts in education,\u00a0health care and other domestic programs rather than on Brexit.Both candidates are now focusing on national security following the assault in London and the\u00a0suicide bombing in Manchester, northern England, two weeks ago that killed 22 people and injured more than 100 at an Ariana Grande concert.The latest poll from market research firm YouGov published Monday estimated that 42% of the electorate intended to vote for the Conservatives,\u00a0which would give them\u00a0305 seats in Parliament, to 38% \u2014\u00a0or 268 seats \u2014\u00a0for Labour, with other parties getting the remaining vote. Weeks earlier, May's party had a double-digit lead and appeared headed for a landslide victory.If neither\u00a0party wins at least 326 of the 650 seats in the House of\u00a0Commons, May or Corbyn\u00a0may try to form a coalition with other parties to create a governing majority. The\u00a0party with the most seats also can\u00a0try to run the country with a minority of seats but another general election would be called if it loses on a key\u00a0vote.Corbyn accused the Conservatives\u00a0of slashing 20,000\u00a0police officers over the last seven years that it has been in power. May was the country\u2019s home secretary \u2014\u00a0or interior minister \u2014\u00a0under her predecessor, David Cameron, a Brexit opponent who resigned after Britons voted a year ago to leave the EU.\"You cannot protect the public on the cheap. The police and security services must get the resources they need, not 20,000 police cuts,\" he said in Carlisle,\u00a0northern England,\u00a0Sunday. \u201cTheresa May was warned by the Police Federation, but she accused them of 'crying wolf.'\"Corbyn told the British broadcaster ITV that he supported calls for May to resign. May said Monday that counter-terrorism resources are well-funded despite the cuts to police staffing.London's Metropolitan Police Chief Cressida Dick said that the terrorist attacks in the U.K. are planned on domestic soil with little foreign coordination.Dick told British radio\u00a0that 23,000 people of potential interest are being monitored\u00a0in Britain, including 500 active investigations. He said five terror plots have been foiled since March.May said she wants to take tough new action to \"stamp out\" extremism, which she said has been tolerated for far too long. She urged major Internet\u00a0companies, such as Facebook and Google, to do more to prevent the spread of radical ideologies and propaganda. That would require a way to balance\u00a0free speech rights with\u00a0the need\u00a0to keep Britons safe.Facebook said it wants to be a \"hostile environment for terrorists,\" \u00a0but it did not propose\u00a0specific measures.\"If we turn the Internet into a tool for censorship and surveillance, the terrorists will have won,\" Tim Farron, the leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats, wrote in an opinion piece for the Guardian newspaper.\u00a0\u00a0\"We won't make ourselves safer by making ourselves less free.\"Farron warned May that counter-terrorism authorities could be overzealous in their attempts to monitor citizens' activity and resemble the surveillance habits of totalitarian states\u00a0like North Korea, where free speech and individual rights do not exist.", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-05T15:43:48Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "But the justices say special elections for at least 28 legislative seats may not be needed before 2018 -- a small victory for Republicans, who had called such a remedy 'the most extreme and intrusive possible.'", "title": "Supreme Court strikes down more North Carolina election districts", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/05/supreme-court-strikes-down-more-north-carolina-election-districts/102512186/", "numberOfLinks": 6, "author": "Richard Wolf", "publishedAt": "2017-06-05T19:06:07+00:00", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a02dcc15343ac763f18a76e656f325063c82d44a/c=0-194-4437-2701&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636322565540365753-AP-Voter-Laws-North-Carolina.jpg", "article": "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Monday struck down dozens of state legislative districts in North Carolina because they disadvantaged black voters, but the justices said special elections this year might not be necessary.The decision was a mixed bag\u00a0for the state, which now has seen both\u00a0legislative and congressional districts rejected because of their emphasis on racial demographics and faces a potential Supreme Court review over excessive partisanship. Last month, the justices refused to reconsider a lower court's ruling that a North Carolina photo-ID law discriminated against black voters \"with almost surgical precision.\"While the court vacated a federal district court order mandating special elections this year for one-year terms, opponents of the redistricting plan vowed to fight that battle again in the lower court.

It calls for creating\u00a0a private, nonprofit corporation,\u00a0with airlines contributing fees rather than the taxes they now pay the government to cover the approximately $10 billion annual cost for air-traffic control.During the rest of the week,\u00a0Trump and other administration officials\u00a0will call on states, cities, and private companies to pay more for rebuilding roads, bridges, railways,\u00a0airports, and other types of infrastructure. The schedule includes meetings with members of Congress, a Wednesday speech in Cincinnati, and an \"infrastructure summit\" Thursday with various governors and mayors.Some Democratic lawmakers said Trump really doesn't have an infrastructure plan. Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said in a tweet that Trump \"is\u00a0\u00a0NOT proposing money for infrastructure. It's tax cuts for financiers, privatizing public property. Not infrastructure.\"Thursday is also the day Comey is set to testify\u00a0before Congress, an event likely to center on the ongoing investigation into links between Trump's campaign last year and Russians who sought to influence the election by hacking Democrats.In firing Comey last month, Trump cited performance issues, while critics accused him trying to close down the Russia investigation. The Justice Department later appointed ex-FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation.Associates of\u00a0Comey said that, according to\u00a0the former director, Trump asked him to lay off an ongoing investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who is also accused of involvement with Russians.Trump, meanwhile, reportedly told Russian officials in an Oval Office meeting that Comey was a \"nut job,\" and that his dismissal would help get the Russia issue behind him.As for infrastructure, moving air-traffic control out of the Federal Aviation Administration has been debated periodically since the 1990s, but never approved by Congress. Trump\u2019s proposal would be modeled on Canada\u2019s system, which is run a private board of industry stakeholders rather than the government.Trump\u2019s principles seek to improve legislation approved in 2016 in the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that never got a vote in the full House or Senate. The debate resumed as part of renewing FAA legislation that expires Sept. 30.Hearings are scheduled Wednesday in the Senate and Thursday in the House.The corporation\u2019s 13-member board would begin with eight members appointed by the transportation secretary, with two representing airlines, two for unions, one for airports, one for general aviation and two for the government. Those eight would choose a chief executive officer, and then that board would choose another four independent board members. But no seats would be assigned to specific interests after the initial board is seated.\u201cThere will not be designated seats by interest group,\" said D.J. Gribbin, special assistant to the president for infrastructure.Airlines and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association supported the 2016 bill as a way to have more predictable funding than provided by annual spending fights in Congress that have led to furloughs and shutdowns in recent years.\u201cI strongly support the president\u2019s continuing recognition that modernizing our country\u2019s air traffic control service is one of the most important infrastructure investments we can make,\u201d Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., whose 2016 bill laid the groundwork for Trump\u2019s proposal, said May 24 of Trump\u2019s budget.Besides smoother funding, airlines and supportive lawmakers contend that the corporation would modernize equipment and training faster than FAA. Government watchdogs have criticized FAA for slow progress on shifting controllers from directing planes by ground-based radar to satellite-based GPS.But the proposal has critics among airlines, general-aviation groups and in Congress.\u201cThere\u2019s not a dime\u2019s worth of difference between President Trump\u2019s plan and Chairman Shuster\u2019s proposal, both of which would hand over America\u2019s skies to a private corporation, free of charge,\u201d said Rep. Donald M. Payne Jr., D-N.J.The top Democrat on Shuster\u2019s committee, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., has argued that airlines would dominate the board and shouldn\u2019t be trusted because of their own technology failures that cancel thousands of flights.Delta Air Lines opposed the 2016 bill because of concerns it would disrupt air-traffic control at a time when FAA is making improvements.General-aviation groups opposed the legislation because of concerns about how they would be charged under the private system and the possibility that airlines would be favored over private pilots at busy airports.In describing the plan, a statement from the Trump administration\u00a0said all users of the system would pay their fair share, but it assured access to general aviation and to rural communities.The leaders of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which decides with House counterparts how much to spend each year on FAA, said the proposal doesn\u2019t appear to make sense. Sens. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said in a Feb. 28 letter that consumers would have no recourse for complaints or mistreatment as they currently enjoy through the Transportation and Congress.", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-05T15:43:48Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "Harvard revoked admissions for at least ten students after discovering they exchanged inappropriate memes in a Facebook chat.

Now, Einbender hopes to work with other animal shelters to help their struggling cone-wearing dogs get adopted.***For more stories like this, LIKE Humankind on Facebook.", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-05T15:43:49Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "Newseum will honor and recognize 14 journalists who died in the pursuit of news in 2016.
