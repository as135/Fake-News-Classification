The complaint claims Winner even acknowledged that she \"knew the contents of the reporting could be used to the injury of the United States and to the advantage of a foreign nation.\"The Intercept says the NSA document details the Russian \"spear-fishing\" attack targeting local government employees with emails that appeared to be from e-voting vendors but were designed to allow hackers to infect and gain control of\u00a0computers.In late October, the hackers sent emails to 122 addresses tied to \"local government organizations,\" the document says, adding that \"officials involved in the management of voter registration systems\" were the likely targets.\"It is unknown whether the aforementioned spear-phishing deployment successfully compromised all the intended victims, and what potential data could have been accessed by the cyber actor,\" the alleged NSA document says. \"However, based upon subsequent targeting, it was likely that at least one account was compromised.\"Contributing: Kevin Johnson", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-06T13:51:11Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "New Siri, augmented reality, and a Venmo-killer.", "title": "11 changes coming to iPhone with Apple's iOS 11", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2017/06/05/6-changes-coming-iphone-apples-ios-11/102517064/", "numberOfLinks": 10, "author": "Edward C.

Here's what's coming, courtesy of Apple's introduction of its new operating system.Apple kept news of a tenth anniversary iPhone under wraps on day one of its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif.But Tim Cook & Co. revealed plenty about the software that will be at the new iPhone\u2019s core when it arrives, likely in the fall. As with prior iterations of Apple\u2019s mobile operating system, iOS 11 also promises new features for current iPhone models. And Apple also reserved special love for iPads that the company can only hope helps revive a sagging brand.More Apple news:\u00a0iOS 11 was released as a developer preview today. Here are eleven of the changes coming to iOS that caught my attention:The faddish popularity of last summer\u2019s Pokemon Go release gave iPhone users an early sense of what augmented reality is all about, essentially layering characters and other \u201cfake\u201d stuff on top of the real world.Using a platform called ARKit, developers will be able to exploit computer vision and take advantage of what Apple maintains will be \u201cthe largest AR platform in the world,\u201d given the vast user base of iPhones and iPads that are out there. I\u2019m eager to see the many ways developers might do just that, in gaming, commerce and more. One thing we know: augmented reality almost always makes for a cool demo, even in its simplest form as when an Apple executive made a faux steaming cup of coffee appear on\u00a0an otherwise barren tabletop.Watch out, Venmo, PayPal and Square. Apple is enabling person-to-person payments inside the Messages app, via Apple Pay and with an assist from Siri. Apple still has some explaining to do when it comes to the finer details. For example, Apple executive Craig Federighi said on stage that when you receive money from a friend it will go into an Apple Pay Cash card, of which I\u2019d like to learn more.Attendees at WWDC 2017 in San Jose.\u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham)At least two of the new features coming to the Maps app are potentially very handy. Apple is adding what is says are detailed floor plan maps at a variety of shopping malls and major airports. And Apple will also provide a \u201clane guidance\u201d view when you take the wheel of a car.iOS 11 can silence notifications to keep you safe while driving.\u00a0(Photo: Apple)Speaking of driving, this genuine safety feature is good news for drivers too easily distracted by notifications and alerts.When you turn on Do Not Disturb While Driving, iOS 11 will silence alert and notifications while keeping the screen dark. iOS 11 will use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to measure that you\u2019re moving in a car and if so, to suggest activating the feature. If it is activated, anyone sending you a message will get an automated response telling them that you\u2019ll see their message when you get where you\u2019re going. If the message  senders want to alert you about is truly urgent, they can reply urgent in the message to permit it to\u00a0get through to you.Crowd of developers gets ready for the start of WWDC in San Jose, Calif.\u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham)The proof will be in the pudding. But Apple insists that through machine learning and artificial intelligence, Siri will indeed get smarter in iOS 11, and also learn more about how to please you with personal experiences and suggestions by learning what you\u2019re doing inside the Safari, News, Mail and Messages apps. Your Siri interactions are synced across devices (and encrypted.) I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ll appreciate the new, supposedly more natural-sounding male and female Siri voices. But international travelers will likely appreciate the fact that Siri will be able to translate English words and phrases into Chinese, French, German and Spanish.iPhone photographers ought to welcome new features coming to the Photos and Camera apps, though of course I haven't put any of these to the test yet. (And who knows what kind of camera will be built into the next iPhone?)\u00a0Such features include the ability to shoot Portrait Mode pictures (currently a feature on the iPhone 7 Plus only) with optical image stabilization. iOS 11 also lets you add effects and trim the short video snippets inside Live Photos images. And a new format called High Efficiency Image File Format can reduce the file size of the pics you take on an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus.New designs of any kind take getting used to but the changes to the Control Center where you can turn on Airplane mode, adjust the audio and more looks to be a positive step. Control Center packs such tools now in a single\u00a0view, which you can get to with an upward swipe gesture. Meanwhile, a\u00a0new lock screen also brings notifications into a unified view.On the design front, the App Store is also getting a makeover. Highlights include a new Today view with featured app content--valuable real estate for chosen app sellers of course--as well as a\u00a0dedicated Games section.This is another feature I'll need to try. But Apple is promising easier one-handed typing, with easy access to numbers, symbols and punctuation.Apple Music subscribers will be able to follow, contribute and listen to shared playlists with friends and create profiles so they in turn can follow you. What\u2019s more, Apple has opened up Apple Music to developers, giving them full access to the 40 million songs in Apple\u2019s cloud catalog. Apple noted on the WWDC stage that Nike can add exercise playlists through the catalog, or Shazam can automatically add the songs it identifies to your music collection. Meantime, while the newly-announced $349 Siri-controlled HomePod speaker isn't coming until December, the new AirPlay 2 feature in iOS 11, will let you control Apple TV and third party speakers in multiple rooms around the house, using Control Center, the Home app or Siri.Beyond the iPhone, Apple says iOS 11 is the biggest software release ever for the iPad. Two benefits worth mentioning: drag and drop support and a new Files app, both of which would make a tablet such as the iPad Pro that much more like a Mac.Email: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-06T13:51:12Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "President indicates he will continue weighing in on legal issues, foreign policy.", "title": "Trump promises to keep tweeting, accuses media of trying to convince him otherwise", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/06/06/donald-trump-twitter-qatar-travel-ban-supreme-court/102542850/", "numberOfLinks": 10, "author": "David M Jackson", "publishedAt": "2017-06-06T13:28:47Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f17fa5c8bcf157fac2442ba26d21e0a295de29a0/c=0-36-4591-2630&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636323346517596392-AFP-AFP-P44L6-91325738.JPG", "article": "WASHINGTON \u2013 So much for the idea of vetting President Trump's tweets.Trump served notice Tuesday that he will keep tweeting away, whether it's about his\u00a0\"travel ban\" from selected Muslim-majority countries, the London Mayor's approach to handling the weekend's terror attack,\u00a0or Middle East politics in general.Once again attacking what he calls the\u00a0mainstream media early Tuesday, Trump said that \"the FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out.\"In a follow-up, Trump said: \"Sorry folks, but if I would have relied on the Fake News of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, washpost or nytimes, I would have had ZERO chance winning WH.\"Trump may have been referring to news reports that White House aides discussed plans to have someone check and vet presidential tweets before they orbit into\u00a0cyberspace, especially ones\u00a0that deal with legal issues.The tweets also come one day after\u00a0lawyers across the ideological spectrum\u00a0say Trump undercut his own legal case\u00a0by tweeting about\u00a0a pending Supreme Court case on the travel ban\u00a0\u2013 in which he took aim at his own Justice Department for arguing for\u00a0\"watered-down, politically correct version.\"George Conway, husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, criticized the tweets for potentially undermining the president's own agenda.\u00a0\"The pt (point)\u00a0cannot be stressed enough that tweets on legal matters ... seriously undermine Admin agenda and POTUS \u2013 and those who support him, as I do, need to reinforce that pt and not be shy about it,\" Conway said in his own flurry of tweets.After re-affirming his Twitter independence on Tuesday morning,\u00a0Trump weighed in on the Middle East and appeared to take credit for decisions by many Arab countries to begin\u00a0cutting ties to the nation of Qatar.\"During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology,\" Trump tweeted. \"Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!\"Meanwhile, a\u00a0growing number of Republican lawmakers are expressing frustration with Trump's Twitter habits.Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman\u00a0Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said Monday: \"Probably it's best to refrain from communicating with 140 characters on topics that are so important.\"", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-06T13:51:12Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "Southwest\u2019s big twice-a-year fare sale was rolled out Tuesday morning.", "title": "72-hour sale: Southwest fares fall below $100 round-trip", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2017/06/06/72-hour-sale-southwest-fares-fall-below-100-round-trip/102542150/", "numberOfLinks": 8, "author": "Ben Mutzabaugh", "publishedAt": "2017-06-06T13:12:50Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2b634632c3eff6aab1565a1553fd84019917b3e0/c=0-445-5609-3614&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636111383669070991-AP-Southwest-Airlines-Pilots-CEO.jpg", "article": "Southwest\u2019s big twice-a-year fare sale is back, with round-trip fares below $100 on dozens of the carrier\u2019s shortest routes.The sale fares also include longer routes, with the price of flights loosely tied to distance. Flights begin at $49 each way on Southwest\u2019s shortest routes and increase to $79, $99 or $129 each way for longer flights.The sale launched Tuesday morning and is good for travel from Aug. 22 through Dec. 13. Flights on Fridays and Sundays are excluded from the sale as are certain dates around the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays. Schedules for Southwest\u2019s Florida and Nevada flights have additional day-of-week restrictions.TODAY IN THE SKY:\u00a0Southwest will end practice of overbooking, CEO saysThe sale fares apply specifically to non-stop options, though many connecting itineraries may also show lower-than-usual fares. Seats sold at the sale prices are capacity controlled, meaning the cheapest seats will likely sell out on individual flights. Southwest\u2019s flights from Albany, N.Y., and Manchester, N.H., are excluded from the sale altogether.Many of Southwest\u2019s international routes are also included in the sale, though those routes come with more day-of-travel restrictions. Fares on those routes range from $59 to about $250 each way, but are good only for flights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays during the sale period.Regardless of the details, bargain seekers will have to act quickly to snag the fares. The sale ends on Thursday (June 8) at 11:59 p.m. local time in the city of the departing flight. (Full sale details)TODAY IN THE SKY: Reno: The biggest little freight hub you\u2019ve never heard of\u00a0(story continues below)However, those used to Southwest\u2019s previous sale fares should be warned that the availability of Southwest\u2019s cheapest fares appears to be somewhat more limited than in past sales. The $49 fares do appear on most days on the advertised routes, but they do not always appear on every flight, according to a quick check of the carrier\u2019s website early Tuesday morning.Using the airline\u2019s Boston-Baltimore route as an example, the $49 one-way fares were available on just three of the airline\u2019s 10 non-stop flights on Nov. 1 (a Wednesday). Fares on five of the day\u2019s other flights were going for a still-low $69 while two others were selling for $150 one way. \u00a0A day later, though, nine of Southwest's 10 daily flights from Boston to Baltimore were on sale for $49 as of early Tuesday morning.Other routes showed the broad availability have made Southwest\u2019s twice-a-year sales so noteworthy. A spot-check of Southwest\u2019s San Francisco-to-Los Angeles for the same day (Nov. 1) showed all 10 of the day\u2019s flights were available for $49 as of early Tuesday morning. The same was true of all 10 flights in the opposite direction for Nov. 7 (a Tuesday).Fares on some routes dropped even lower than the advertised fares. Flights between Spokane, Wash., and Boise \u2013 for example \u2013 were selling for as little as $92 round-trip early Tuesday morning. The same was true for a handful of other routes, including a limited number of $90 round-trip fares for Southwest\u2019s flights between Chicago Midway and Minneapolis/St. Paul.The takeaway: While the sale fares are widely available through the sale window, customers with the greatest schedule flexibility will have the best luck securing the lowest advertised fares. Still, fliers should remember that the cheapest seats will likely begin to sell out as the sale goes on.The broad fare sale has become a staple for Southwest. It has rolled out similar three-day sales each June and October for the past several years. One sale from June 2015 proved so popular that it crashed Southwest\u2019s website, prompting the carrier to extend that particular sale by an additional 24 hours. Southwest's website did not appear to be having any such issues during the current sale.IN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos (story continues below)In previous iterations of the sale earlier this decade, Southwest pegged fares to mileage thresholds. For example, Southwest's sales priced flights of 500 miles or less at $49 each way and increased from there. Flights of 501 to 1,000 miles cost $99 each way and flights of 1,001 to 1,500 miles cost $129 each way. Flights of more than 1,500 miles went for $149 each way.While Southwest has ended the precise mileage component of its big sales, its latest versions do closely mimic the previous distance-based sales. The carrier's four advertised sale-fare tiers \u2014 $49, $79, $129 and $149 each way \u2014 are similar to the prices offered on the distance-based sales of years past.Whatever the details, travelers can snag advertised round-trip fares as low as $98 on short routes. \u00a0Even on the airline\u2019s longest cross-country routes, fares are as low as $258.Among the sub-$100 options with reasonable availability as of Tuesday morning were: Atlanta-Richmond, Va.; Albuquerque-Phoenix; Austin-Harlingen, Texas; Baltimore-Boston; Boise-Spokane; Burbank-San Francisco; Chicago Midway-Minneapolis/St. Paul; Cincinnati-Chicago Midway; Columbus, Ohio-Nashville; Dallas Love-Austin; Hartford-Baltimore; Des Moines-St. Louis; Memphis-Chicago Midway; Detroit-Baltimore; Fort Lauderdale-Tampa; Houston Hobby-Dallas Love; Indianapolis-Washington Reagan National; Jacksonville, Fla.-Atlanta; Kansas City-Milwaukee; Las Vegas-Oakland; Little Rock-St. Louis; Long Beach, Calif.-Sacramento; Los Angeles-El Paso; Los Angeles-Tucson; Milwaukee-Nashville; Minneapolis/St. Paul-Kansas City; Oklahoma City-Houston Hobby; Pittsburgh-Chicago Midway; Portland, Ore.-San Francisco; Reno-San Jose, Calif.; Salt Lake City-San Diego; Sacramento-Spokane; Washington Reagan National-Providence.IN PICTURES:\u00a0Southwest Airlines unveils wider seats for its Boeing 737sA Southwest Airlines jet gets ready to land at Tampa International Airport on June 6, 2016.\u00a0(Photo: Skip O'Rourke, Tampa Bay Times via AP)", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-06T13:51:13Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "Zaghba, who is believed to be an Italian national of Moroccan descent, was shot dead along with accomplices Khuram Butt and Rachid Redouane.", "title": "London attack: Police name Youssef Zaghba, 22, as third terrorist", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/06/06/london-terror-attack-police-raids/102541968/", "numberOfLinks": 19, "author": "Jane Onyanga-Omara", "publishedAt": "2017-06-06T13:19:13Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7e522c4e141f354559ff07e7188d771b832dd473/c=0-83-4737-2759&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636323214851581054-AFP-AFP-PA8DQ-91472592.JPG", "article": "LONDON \u2014 Police named the third attacker in the deadly terrorist rampage that\u00a0killed seven people\u00a0here over the weekend as\u00a0Youssef Zaghba, 22, from the eastern part of the British capital.Zaghba, who is believed to be an Italian national of Moroccan descent, was shot dead along with accomplices\u00a0Khuram\u00a0Butt\u00a0and\u00a0Rachid Redouane\u00a0following the incident\u00a0on London Bridge and at nearby Borough Market on Saturday night.\u00a0Butt and Redouane\u00a0were named by authorities on Monday.The Metropolitan Police said Zaghba\u00a0was not a subject of interest to police or\u00a0MI5, the domestic security agency.Police searched\u00a0the homes of relatives of\u00a0Butt\u00a0\u2014 a Pakistani-born British citizen\u00a0\u2014 and a restaurant run by\u00a0his\u00a0family members in Jhelum, a city 60 miles southeast of the Pakistani capital Islamabad Monday night,\u00a0the Telegraph\u00a0and\u00a0the Sun reported. Authorities suspect\u00a0Butt was radicalized in the U.K. and not in\u00a0Pakistan, the newspapers said.Butt, 27, worked for\u00a0London Underground\u00a0\u00a0as a trainee customer services assistant\u00a0for just under six months, leaving in October last year.\u00a0The Telegraph\u00a0reported that he worked\u00a0at Westminster tube station, just a stone's throw from\u00a0Parliament\u00a0and had access to tunnels that run under that building. The area near Parliament was itself the victim of a terror attack in March that killed five people.An undated handout picture released by the British Metropolitan Police Service in London on June 5, 2017 shows Khuram Shazad Butt (left) and Rachid Redouane from Barking, east London, believed by police to be two of the three attackers in the June 3 terror attack on London Bridge.\u00a0(Photo: HANDOUT, AFP/Getty Images)Butt and\u00a0Redouane\u00a0were both from Barking in east London.\u00a0Redouane, 30, who claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan, also used the name Rachid Elkhdar, with a different date of birth.All three attackers were shot dead by police after ramming a van into pedestrians on the bridge and stabbing people in the market. The Islamic State claimed responsibility.A 27-year-old man was arrested\u00a0in Barking Tuesday in connection with the investigation.A minute's silence was held across the country in memory of the victims at 11 a.m. local time Tuesday. Thousands of people attended a\u00a0vigil for the victims in London on Monday evening.Authorities said Butt was known to security services but Redouane\u00a0was not. Twelve people who were arrested in Barking on Sunday in connection with the attack have been released without charge.Italian news agency ANSA reported Tuesday that Zaghba was held at Bologna airport in March 2016 as he was about to catch\u00a0a flight to Istanbul in\u00a0Turkey. It said he raised suspicion because he had just a small backpack, a passport and a one-way ticket. Many foreign fighters travel from Turkey to neighboring\u00a0Syria to join militants such as the Islamic State.Police searched his home\u00a0but no \"particular elements\" were found other than\u00a0religious documents that\u00a0were downloaded from extremist sites, ANSA reported.\u00a0Zaghba was released.Police named\u00a0Kirsty Boden, 28,\u00a0an Australian nurse who lived in London, as one of the victims on Tuesday.\u00a0Christine Archibald, 30, a Canadian social worker who moved to Europe to be with her fianc\u00e9, was the first victim to be named. French authorities said a French national was also killed.Melissa McMullan told reporters on Monday that she believed her brother James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in east London, was also killed in the attack\u00a0after police told the family that his bank card was found on one of the bodies.Forty-eight people were injured, 21 of them critically. NBC News reported that an American man who was shot in the head by a stray police bullet was expected to survive. The U.S. Embassy in London said it was aware of reports that U.S. citizens were injured, and was not aware that any had been killed.London Mayor Sadiq Khan suggested that President Trump\u2019s state visit to Britain, scheduled for later this year, should be cancelled in an interview Monday.Earlier Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May said she thought Khan was doing \"a\u00a0great job,\u201d after President Trump\u00a0derided and misrepresented\u00a0the London mayor\u2019s attempt\u00a0to calm Londoners after the attack.\u201cAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \"no reason to be alarmed!\"\u00a0Trump tweeted Sunday.\u00a0\u00a0Khan had told\u00a0Londoners there was no \u201creason to be alarmed\u201d by an increased police presence, and\u00a0said of the terrorists,\u00a0\u201cwe will never let them win.\u201dEarly Monday, Trump tweeted: \"Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his 'no reason to be alarmed'\u00a0statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!\"Khan told British TV station Channel 4 on Monday evening: \"I don't think we should roll out\u00a0the red carpet\u00a0to the president of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for.\"Lewis Lukens, the acting U.S. ambassador to the U.K. tweeted: \u201cI commend the strong leadership of the mayor of London as he leads the city forward after this heinous attack.\u201dWhite House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders said\u00a0Trump was not \u201cpicking a fight\u201d\u00a0with Khan and that it was \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201dthat his criticism was because Khan is Muslim. Some social media users in Britain pointed out that Trump had not criticized\u00a0Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, whose city was targeted by a deadly suicide bombing last month.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Tuesday that he saw \u201cno reason to rescind\" the invitation to Trump for a state visit.The Muslim Council of Britain\u00a0said more than 130 imams and religious leaders from around the country refused to perform funeral prayers for the attackers.Geoff Ho, a journalist who was stabbed in the neck as he fought a terrorist in Borough Market,\u00a0released a statement Tuesday saying that\u00a0held off\u00a0unarmed\u00a0attackers near a pub until the police arrived. Two minutes later the assailants arrived at a nearby restaurant and Ho hit\u00a0one of them and was\u00a0stabbed.He thanked hospital staff and all who had supported him. \"Also, I want to make it clear that many of my friends are Muslim.

Gen. Steve Townsend, the coalition commander.Raqqa is the remaining stronghold of the terror group\u2019s so-called caliphate. Iraqi forces are close to clearing Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city, from Islamic State control.\"It's hard to convince new recruits that ISIS is a winning cause when they just lost their twin 'capitals' in both Iraq and Syria,\" Townsend said in a statement.The offensive is being led by a coalition of Kurdish and Arab forces, which are backed by coalition advisers and airstrikes. The Trump administration recently announced it would begin supplying the Kurdish forces with arms and equipment to help in the offensive against the Islamic State, which is also called ISIS.Turkey, which is helping in the anti-ISIS fight, is opposed to the support for the Kurds because of fears the ethnic group will push for its long-time goal of carving out an independent state in parts of Turkey, Iraq and Syria.The U.S.-backed forces have\u00a0been working to surround the city since November to cut off supply routes in and out of the area.The Pentagon announced recently that the coalition\u2019s tactics are designed to annihilate the terror group so that its fighters cannot\u00a0escape to establish strongholds elsewhere or launch terror attacks against Western targets.\"We all saw the heinous attack in Manchester, England,\" Townsend said in the statement.\u00a0 \"ISIS threatens all of our nations, not just Iraq and Syria, but in our own homelands as well.

The filings detailed the work the firm engaged in between Oct. 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017 on behalf of the Saudis, Bahrain and other foreign governments.In a statement Monday night, Trump Organization officials said they would donate any profits from the transactions at the end of the year.The disclosure of Saudi spending, however,\u00a0could\u00a0spark fresh debate about President Trump\u2019s decision to retain ownership of his real-estate and branding empire while serving in the White House. Trump turned over management of his companies to his adult sons and a veteran Trump Organization executive\u00a0but still can benefit financially from his business interests.Last month, Trump visited Saudi Arabia, the first stop on the first foreign trip of his presidency.Read more:The firm reported paying more than $190,200 for lodging, $78,204 for catering and roughly $1,600 for parking at the Trump International Hotel in Washington \u2014 part of a larger campaign by the Saudis that brought U.S. military veterans to the nation\u2019s capital to lobby against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act or JASTA. The Daily Caller\u00a0first reported on the hotel payments.Last year, Congress passed a bill over President Obama\u2019s veto that would allow families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001\u00a0terrorist attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any alleged role in the plot. The Gulf nation has denied any role in the attacks and is lobbying to ease the law\u2019s provisions.Democrats on Capitol Hill and ethics watchdogs have argued that Trump\u2019s continued ownership of his businesses could lead to a violation of the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause, which bars foreign payments to U.S. officials without congressional approval.White House officials referred questions about the Saudi payments to the Trump Organization.Before he took office, Trump pledged to donate foreign profits from his hotels to the U.S. Treasury. However, the Trump Organization is not trying to comprehensively identify all foreign profits to its hotel business, according to a company policy document recently provided to the House Oversight Committee.\u201cTo fully and completely identify all patronage at our properties by customer type is impractical in the service industry and putting forth a policy that requires all guests to identify themselves would impede upon personal privacy and diminish the guest experience of our brand,\u201d the Trump Organization\u2019s document said.Read more:\u00a0", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-06T13:51:14Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "Authorities in Columbus, Ga., are searching for a white van with blacked-out windows after police said a boy of about 10 years old was snatched from the street.", "title": "Police in Columbus, Ga., hunt for white van with tinted windows after boy snatched from street", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/06/06/police-columbus-ga-hunt-van-tinted-windows-after-boy-abducted/373069001/", "numberOfLinks": 4, "author": "Matthew Diebel", "publishedAt": "2017-06-06T11:51:02Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cce533b5d66270d03eaafa4664de1787ca24b3da/c=0-29-575-354&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636323284179908794-VAN14065300-G.png", "article": "Authorities in Columbus, Ga., are searching for a white van with blacked-out windows after police said a boy of about 10 years old was allegedly snatched from the street on Monday evening.According to local media, witnesses told law enforcement that a black male in his late 30s or early 40s pulled the boy, who is white, into the vehicle, which is described as a white utility van, reported local TV station WRBL.The van had a Georgia license plate with a \u201cK\u201d as one of the letters, the station quoted the police as saying.

He also banned her from social media and ordered her to complete various other forms of probation and community service until age 21.Zion Snow, 17, who was accused of planning the attack but never punching Joyner-Francis, was sentenced to 18 months of community supervision.\"It is a case in which no one is looking to determine who wins and who loses because everyone has lost,\" said Family Court Judge Robert Coonin. \"The community has lost, the defendants and their families have lost, and most importantly, Amy's family has lost.\"Nothing that any of us say or do here can ever change that \u2013 myself included.\"Last April, 16-year-old Joyner-Francis died after a brutal fight in the high school bathroom exacerbated her pre-existing heart condition. Dozens of girls watched the confrontation as it unfolded, and at least two recorded it on their cell phones.Video and social media postings helped the state secure convictions against two out of the three girls accused of having a role in the planning and carrying out of the attack.In Family Court in Wilmington on Monday, the two girls \u2013 Carr and Snow \u2013 appeared before Coonin for sentencing. Behind them sat not only their parents, but Joyner-Francis' family members.Although Joyner-Francis' family did not speak, Deputy Attorney General Phillip Casale read a letter from her mother\u00a0in which she said changes need to be made to the criminal justice system so juveniles will think twice before harming anyone.STORY: Joyner verdict shows 'consequences' of actionsSTORY: Editorial: Joyner-Francis verdict has no silver lining\"They took another human being's life,\" Inita B. Joyner wrote. \"A child's life, my baby's life, and this is not acceptable in any manner.\"In the letter, Joyner-Francis' mother recalled her daughter as a child \"full of life\" who dreamed of becoming a doctor or pursuing a law career.\"As Amy's mother, I am very proud of the positive person she has become,\" Joyner said. \"Amy never ceased to amaze me with how mature and kind she was.\"Casale argued that a prison term would send a message to Carr and the community about what is expected of teens, even though her conviction for criminally negligent homicide and third-degree conspiracy came with no mandatory incarceration in Family Court.Prosecutors sought last year to have Carr tried as an adult in Superior Court, where she could have faced up to eight years in prison, but the judge determined she was amenable to rehabilitation in Family Court.Amy Inita Joyner-Francis, 16, died after an assault in a bathroom at Howard High School in Wilmington in April 2016.\u00a0(Photo: BRITTANY HORN/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Coonin again disagreed with prosecutors on Monday when Casale and State Prosecutor Sean Lugg requested Carr be sent to a facility in Indiana, since Delaware has no juvenile prison for females.Carr's attorney, John Deckers, argued that the cornerstone of juvenile justice is that children shouldn't be judged by the worst thing they've ever done. The focus must be rehabilitation and the best interest of the child, he said.\"Children are well worth the investment of time and services because they are mentally, psychologically resilient and open to change,\" he said. \"Their behavior is correctable, and they are capable of becoming caring, productive members of society.\"Deckers added that the public backlash Carr has faced should not be underestimated.\"This is a very real consequence to Trinity and her family and her siblings and her parents that survives no matter what happens, no matter what sentence this court imposes,\" he said. \"Please, your honor, don't underestimate the vile, despicable nature of this backlash.\"Deckers said Carr is making positive changes in her life by attending counseling, following her pre-trial conditions and sharing her story with teens.After hearing the two sides, Coonin decided that prison in another state would not be appropriate. He ordered Carr to be taken to Grace Cottage, followed by non-residential after-care treatment until age 19 and then two years of adult probation.Carr must also complete 500 hours of community service with an emphasis on serving young people who have been abused or bullied and pay a to-be-determined amount of restitution.Snow, who was found delinquent of third-degree conspiracy, was sentenced to 18 months of community supervision and 300 hours of community service.Coonin said he hopes that by banning both from social media while they are serving their sentences, it will help them regain an \"appropriate appreciation\" for others and understand the effect of social media.\u201cI hope, with this sentence, that you can gain the tools to understand and perhaps help others so this horrible event does not get repeated,\" Coonin said.Monday's sentencing came more than a year after the fatal fight shook not only the school community, but the state and nation.During an April bench trial in Family Court, prosecutors accused Carr, Snow and Chakiera Wright of planning the confrontation in the 20 hours before the attack. Wright was found not delinquent\u00a0after Coonin said there was insufficient evidence to show she participated in the plan.Councilwoman Sherry Dorsey Walker, speaks to media after the sentencing of Trinity Carr and Zion Snow for their roles in the death of Howard High School classmate Amy Inita Joyner-Francis.\u00a0(Photo: Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal)At the center of the prosecution's case was cellphone video of the assault. The video shows Carr dragging Joyner-Francis by her long, braided hair through a handicap-accessible stall in the bathroom. Carr swings her arms and lands punches onto the head and torso of Joyner-Francis, who was on the floor clutching her purse.During the trial, the attorneys litigated questions such as what a \u201creasonable\u201d person should expect as a result of a fight, what type of clothing is worn by kids preparing to\u00a0fight, and whether Joyner-Francis was a participant in the fight. The defense argued Carr could not have foreseen that Joyner-Francis would die as a result of the fight.Furthermore, evidence presented during trial \u2013\u00a0including threatening messages posted by Snow on social media saying \u201cwe gonna get her\u201d \u2013\u00a0demonstrated Carr and Snow were planning to attack Joyner-Francis, Coonin said.After Monday's sentencing, Deckers declined to comment. Lugg called the sentence \"appropriate.\"\"As all noted, Amy can never be brought back,\" he said. \"But this is something that will hopefully give closure to all involved and allow for this community to heal.\"Sherry Dorsey Walker, former Wilmington councilwoman who was acting as a spokesperson for Joyner-Francis\u2019 family, said the family knew the type of justice they wanted would not be possible with the case being tried in Family Court.\"I don't think there will ever be anything such as closure as it pertains to this situation because Amy will never come home,\" she said. \"So while one of the assailants gets to be at Grace Cottage and her parents can come visit her on a regular basis that is not something Amy's family can do.\"Contact Jessica Masulli Reyes at 302-324-2777, jmreyes@delawareonline.com or Twitter @JessicaMasulli.\u00a0", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-06T13:51:21Z"}]
