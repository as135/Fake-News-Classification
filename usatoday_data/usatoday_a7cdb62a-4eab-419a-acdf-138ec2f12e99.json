I haven't spoken to counsel yet. I don't know how they're going to respond.\"Earlier Friday, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said on ABC's Good Morning America\u00a0that \"the president will make that decision.\"\"When Director Comey goes to testify, I think that will be a very clarifying moment,\" she said. \"It's more important to have somebody testify under oath, frankly, than to have his friends and his former colleagues out there speaking to the media, not under oath.\"Comey's much-anticipated testimony is expected to focus on his\u00a0conversations with Trump, including about allegations that the president asked Comey to back off the FBI's investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump\u00a0abruptly fired Comey\u00a0on May 9 as Comey was leading that investigation.Trump fired Flynn in February\u00a0amid questions about whether he inappropriately talked about U.S. sanctions against Russia with a Russian official and then misled Vice President Pence about it.Both the House and Senate Intelligence committees have issued subpoenas for Flynn's testimony and documents from his businesses.Read more:Executive privilege is a legal doctrine that allows a president to withhold information from other branches of government\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 in this case, Congress. In 1974, during the Watergate scandal, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in U.S. v. Nixon that executive privilege can only be invoked in certain circumstances, such as when a president is trying to protect national security or confidential advice from aides.Legal experts said Trump doesn't have a good legal argument to invoke the privilege to block Comey's testimony.\"I think the president has effectively waived the privilege in this case because he has communicated publicly, in several different public formats, about his conversations with Mr. Comey,\" said Mark Rozell, an expert on executive privilege and the dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University in Virginia.Trump talked about his conversations with Comey in TV interviews and on Twitter, making it hard for him to claim that they should be kept confidential now, Rozell said.\"Yet again, the president was not careful,\" the dean said. \"If he had any intention of claiming executive privilege, he ultimately weakened his own case severely.\"Trump also has less power to claim the privilege in regard to conversations with an ex-employee who no longer works for the executive branch, Rozell said.\"In this case, we're talking about private citizen James Comey,\" he said.Andrew Wright, an associate professor at the Savannah Law School in Georgia who served as associate counsel to former president Barack Obama, said executive privilege was designed to allow a president to keep an aide's advice confidential or protect national security.\"It was not designed to allow the president to say, 'Let's silence a critic,' \" Wright said. \"That's not how it works.\"The privilege can't be used to shield government misconduct\u00a0\u2014 such as allegations that Trump may have tried to obstruct justice by asking Comey to drop the FBI's investigation of Flynn, Wright said.\"Courts have ruled that government misconduct is an exception to the doctrine of executive privilege,\" he said.Rozell said \"a rational person\" wouldn't try to invoke the privilege.\"A rational person looking at the cost-benefit ratio\u00a0\u2014 what's the chance of success and is it even worth trying\u00a0\u2014 would ultimately conclude don't do it,\" he said. \"But we all know this is a president who plays by his own set of rules and is very unpredictable.\"Politically, invoking the privilege could hurt the president by furthering the impression that he has something to hide, Rozell said.\"If I were his attorney, my advice would be: Mr. President, if you've done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide, cooperate with the investigation, be completely transparent, you have nothing to be afraid of,' \" he said.", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-02T21:42:00Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "The comedian says Trump is invoking the power of the government in his feuds, adding, \"They\u2019re using me as the shiny object so nobody talks about his FBI investigation.\"", "title": "Kathy Griffin: Donald Trump is messing with the 'wrong redhead'", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/06/02/kathy-griffin-and-lisa-bloom-say-trrump-feud-is-not-a-fair-fight/102426450/", "numberOfLinks": 9, "author": "Jayme Deerwester", "publishedAt": "2017-06-02T21:13:44Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/694a82a01798d61ccef30f97f93b781b57eb346a/c=0-188-3000-1883&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636320071571467071-GTY-691584578.jpg", "article": "p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Arial; min-height: 16.0px} p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Helvetica; min-height: 17.0px}Kathy Griffin and civil-rights lawyer\u00a0Lisa Bloom came for Donald Trump Friday.

For decades, the relentless Chukchi Sea has been washing away the fine sand that makes up Sarichef Island and this I\u00f1upiaq village of 650 now faces a stark choice: Move or drown.\u201cYou are taking away our identity,\u201d Weyiouanna says. \u201cThat\u2019s like a punch in the gut. That\u2019s who we are \u2014 we are tied to this land and the sea.\u201dRegardless of debates about climate change, there\u2019s no question the island is shrinking. Satellite images taken over the past 20 years show\u00a0how far the shoreline has receded, drawing ever-closer to the small homes huddled on what is little more than a large sandbar.Federal officials estimate the island loses somewhere between nine and 22 feet of shoreline every year, although a massive seawall built from rocks barged in from the mainland has slowed the process.Still, that rock wall protects only the hardest-hit areas from erosion, and the wind carries away sand year-round from the island\u2019s highest point, about 20 feet above sea level.Many of the native people here blame human-caused climate change for accelerating the island\u2019s erosion, and worry that President Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement will supercharge the destruction that\u2019s already occurring. One government estimate says the majority of the town\u2019s homes could be uninhabitable within 15 years.Girls living in Shishmaref, Alaska, pose for a photo with their bikes during a sunny early spring day. Experts say the island on which Shishmaref sits will likely be all-but-uninhabitable by the time these four are finished high school.\u00a0(Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY)What\u2019s worse, they say, is Trump's proposed federal budget would eliminate funds they hoped could pay to relocate the village to the mainland some 20 miles away in what would be a years-long logistics nightmare of barges, temporary roads and construction of a new airstrip. One U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimate put the moving cost at $180 million for a town where the median household income is less than $30,000 annually. And Shishmaref is just one of more than 180 coastal towns in Alaska facing such problems, although federal officials say it's one of the most precariously situated.Beyond cost, a move raises more\u00a0personal questions.\u00a0Community\u00a0identity here is often tied to a specific location, where fathers pass down tips about the best hunting sites to their sons, where grandmothers take kids fishing for dinner\u00a0and where virtually everyone is related to their neighbor.\"We have no choice. Our island is getting smaller. It isn't getting bigger,\" said ivory carver Edwin\u00a0Weyiouanna.Understanding what\u2019s happening to Sarichef Island requires a bit of a history and geology lesson. The island, about 100 miles from the Russian mainland, is part of a land bridge that once connected the North American continent to Asia. Researchers\u00a0have concluded North America was initially populated by people and animals that made their way across that land bridge before it disappeared. The people who live on the coasts of both continents are related to each other, and used to routinely shuttle across in boats before the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union ended that practice. On a clear day, you can Russia from their island.Today, the residents of Shishmaref live a largely subsistence-based lifestyle. They boat to the mainland to hunt caribou and ducks\u00a0and gather berries. They fish\u00a0and shoot seals for meat for them and their dogs.Few have running water inside their homes. Instead, they buy water delivered by barge during the summer\u00a0and collect crystal-clear freshwater ice from the mainland for drinking. They also depend heavily on food stamps to buy dried ramen noodles and eight kinds of Spam at the town\u2019s two grocery stores, along with so much soda that the town\u2019s dentist shakes his head in frustration. Health care is provided to most everyone for free under Medicaid.Without running water, few people have flush toilets. Instead, they use buckets fitted with toilet seats, and then bag up the waste for transport it to a sewage lagoon. Trash gets hauled to a landfill at the island\u2019s south end and burned, and animal carcasses lie half buried in the snow or dirt.The sun sits low on the western horizon above Shishmaref at about 11 p.m. as two residents walk back home from an evening trip to the store.\u00a0(Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY)Dogs chained up outside the modest houses bark at strangers, and residents drive most everywhere on four-wheelers or snowmobiles or side-by-sides, rather than walking the few blocks from one end of the town to the other. Many of the approximately 150 houses are owned by the local housing authority, and local government is the largest employer here. The land on which the town sits is owned by the tribe's native corporation, which means few people have any significant financial resources of their own.The plot where they might relocate\u00a0is about 20\u00a0miles away on the mainland and also owned by the tribal corporation. It's surrounded by\u00a0the 2.6 million-acre Bering Land Bridge National Reserve, which means the federal government's permission would be required to build\u00a0roads to the new townsite, and to create a quarry for foundation materials.Flights off the island cost about $400 round trip, and that will only get you to Nome, population\u00a03,500, about 120 miles away. The Army Corps estimates moving and assimilating the entire population of Shishmaref into Nome would cost about half what it would take to rebuild\u00a0the town in an entirely new location, but residents here say that would destroy their entire sense of identity.This island, be it ever so humble, is home.At least for another decade. Maybe. It depends\u00a0on whether sea level rise\u00a0speeds up, a big storm again knocks out the defensive wall\u00a0or warmer winters continue melting the protective sea ice that surrounds the island for much of the year. The ground itself is softening, the once-frozen permafrost melting, and there\u2019s little vegetation to stop the top layers from blowing away.\u201cI wish we didn\u2019t have to move,\u201d said Lorraine Jungers as she shopped at one of the stores with her teenage daughter. \u201cI know the benefits of moving. But we\u2019d be too far apart from the people that mean the most to us. This is our whole life right here. I can\u2019t picture us anywhere else.\u201dCrosses mark graves at the cemetery in Shishmaref. The cemetery is one of the island's highest points, but that's only about 20 feet above sea level.\u00a0(Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY)Some residents don\u2019t think the town will move. They say there\u2019s no way to pay for it and no way to physically move an entire village across miles of open water to reach the\u00a0mainland. In that event, residents here would slowly disperse over time as the water flowed its way inland.Even if the relocation happens, they fear there will be\u00a0no way to maintain the same sense of community in a\u00a0new place. Other struggles include questions over\u00a0polar bears coming onto the mainland, whether to move the bodies buried in the\u00a0island's small cemetery\u00a0and how to overcome\u00a0the inertia that comes with having lived in the same small piece of land for generations.The effort to move has been underway, in some form of another, for years. Residents have voted multiple times to relocate to the mainland and\u00a0several have testified before Congress.\u00a0A youth ambassador from Shishmaref attended the Paris climate talks in 2015.Edwin Weyiouanna shows off a carving made from mastadon ivory, whale baleen and rabbit fur. Many Shishmaref residents carve items like this to sell to tourists on the mainland. Brokers buy up pieces from several artists, buy a plane ticket to Anchorage or Fairbanks, and sell them for three times what the artisan receives.\u00a0(Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY)Still, not much has changed despite more than a decade of lobbying, votes and media attention.\u00a0And the clock is ticking. Shishmaref native Esau Sinnok has already seen the island lose at least 100 feet of coastline in his 19\u00a0years, and a dozen houses, including his grandmother\u2019s, were relocated in 1997 to stave off immediate collapse into the ocean.Emergency protection efforts have proven costly: In 2001, the state paid $110,000 to install sand-filled wire baskets along the western shore. They lasted through only the next storm. A more expensive and extensive sea wall built in pieces in the late 2000s has helped protect a small portion of the island\u2019s western closest to homes, but satellite images show it merely moved the erosion problem a little further along the shore, closer to the airstrip.The lack of action under President Obama frustrated\u00a0Shishmaref residents\u00a0ready to move. They wonder why Obama could commit so many billions of dollars to fighting climate change abroad while not doing more to help American citizens facing imminent danger.Still, things will be worse, they fear, under Trump.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe climate change is real,\u201d said Annie Weyiouanna. \u201cAnd I see that and think it\u2019s scary.\u201d", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-02T21:42:01Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "Three Penn State officials - former president Graham Spanier, former athletic director Tim Curley and Gary Schultz - each were sentenced to prison after being convicted of child endangerment.", "title": "Three Penn State officials sentenced to jail in Jerry Sandusky case", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2017/06/02/penn-state-jail-sentence-child-endangerment-graham-spanier-tim-curley-gary-schultz/102426832/", "numberOfLinks": 2, "author": "Scott Gleeson", "publishedAt": "2017-06-02T18:18:02Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c869de7572021911aeb9b505eb7d081e4a342422/c=0-44-4569-2625&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636320081700827049-AP-PENN-STATE-ABUSE-91379522.JPG", "article": "Former Penn State officials Tim Curley, Gary Schultz and Graham Spanier were all sentenced to jail time Friday for failing to alert authorities to the allegations against ex-football coach Jerry Sandusky, allowing the now-convicted serial predator to continue molesting boys for years.All three were convicted of child endangerment. Schultz, the former university vice president, could serve a minimum of two months in jail and a maximum of 23 months. Curley, the former university athletic director, could serve a minimum of three months in jail and maximum of 23 months. And Spanier, the former university president, could serve a minimum of two months and a maximum of 12 months. All three are also poised to have house arrest after the jail time.Prosecutors in the case argued that the ex-Penn State staffers failed as leaders and cared more about themselves and the school\u2019s image than protecting the children. Judge John Boccabella in the case called it a \u201cShakespearean tragedy\u201d and was befuddled by the former administrators lack of action.\u201cThese men are good people who made a terrible mistake,\u201d the judge said. \u201cWhy no one made a phone call to police \u2026 is beyond me.\u201cAll three ignored the opportunity to put an end to (Sandusky\u2019s) crimes when they had a chance to do so.\"\u201cI deeply regret I didn\u2019t intervene more forcefully,\u201d Spanier said, expressing remorse, in reference to Sandusky\u2019s victims. Spanier will appeal a misdemeanor of child endangerment charge that both Schultz and Curley pleaded guilty on.Curley and Schultz also told the court they were sorry they didn\u2019t do more.\u201cI am very remorseful I did not comprehend the severity of the situation. I sincerely apologize to the victims and to all who were impacted because of my mistake,\u201d Curley said.Said Schultz: \u201cIt really sickens me to think I might have played a part in children being hurt. I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t do more, and I apologize to the victims.\u201dAll three individuals were received two years of probation, 200 hours of community service, and fines. Spanier was fined $7,500, while Schultz and Curley were fined $5,000.Sandusky is serving a 30 to 60-year prison term after being convicted\u00a0of sexually abusing 10 boys.Spanier\u2019s trial revolved around testimony by an ex-graduate coaching assistant, Mike McQueary, who said he reported seeing Sandusky molesting a boy in 2001.Sandusky was not arrested until 2011, after an anonymous email to a county prosecutor led investigators to approach McQueary. Sandusky was found guilty the next year of sexually abusing 10 boys and is serving a prison sentence of 30 to 60 years while he appeals his conviction. At least four victims at Sandusky\u2019s trial said they were molested after 2001.The scandal led to the firing of beloved football coach Joe Paterno shortly after Sandusky\u2019s arrest, and he died of cancer two months later at the age of 85.The Hall of Fame coach was never charged with a crime, but a report commissioned by the university concluded he was part of an effort to keep a lid on the allegations against Sandusky for fear of bad publicity.Penn State\u2019s football program suffered heavy sanctions from the NCAA, and the university has paid out nearly a quarter-billion dollars in fines, court verdicts, settlements and other costs.McQueary testified about how he went to Paterno a day after the shower encounter to discuss what he had seen. Paterno notified Curley and Schultz, and McQueary met with both of them about a week later. In his 2011 grand jury testimony, Paterno said he was told by McQueary the encounter involved \u201cfondling\u201d and was of \u201ca sexual nature,\u201d but wasn\u2019t sure what the act was.The prosecution\u2019s key evidence included notes and email exchanges in which Curley, Schultz and Spanier debated what to do after McQueary\u2019s report.PHOTOS: PENN STATE OFFICIALS SENTENCING MEMORANDUMContributing: The Associated Press", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-02T21:42:01Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "We talk to five women who wrote publicly about their own sexual assaults after Stanford, some for the first time.", "title": "Emily Doe's letter to Brock Turner: 1 year later, 5 survivors speak out on the letter that inspired millions", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/02/emily-does-letter-brock-turner-1-year-later-5-women-speak-out/354824001/", "numberOfLinks": 21, "author": "Alia E.

It was 1996.\"Rape and sexual assault were barely part of the lexicon,\" she wrote\u00a0on Medium after the Stanford case last year, the first time she talked about her rape publicly. \"I had no idea that\u2019s what it was even called.\"Taylor's post, An Open Letter to Dan Turner, Father of #BrockTurner, tore into the\u00a0letter Dan Turner\u00a0wrote to the judge in his son's case, asking for leniency and laying out the ways Brock's life had been \u201cdeeply altered forever\u201d over \u201c20 minutes of action.\u201dWhy she spoke out\"I think there were a lot of people who read Emily Doe's statement and sort of felt this sense of awe of what she'd\u00a0written... I was just blown away. I think she put into words what so many women feel and just totally nailed it. ...I read that post on a Saturday, and then on Sunday I saw that note from Brock Turner's dad whining about how Brock couldn't eat Ribeyes anymore, and I just had this mental image in my head of Emily Doe reading that after having poured out her heart and being so brave and speaking for so many of us. I just kind of had this like, 'Hold my beer' moment ... So I banged out that letter.\"After she spoke out\"I think\u00a0any sort of relief I experienced\u00a0was immediately replaced by this \u2014 I don't want to call it a burden because really it was an honor \u2014 but this outpouring of stories from friends and family saying 'me too, me too, me too.'\u00a0And all of a sudden you're just like, 'What? Wait, all of us?'\"A part of Emily Doe's letter that resonated with her\"There were certainly enough differences to where it was not an identical situation, and yet everything she said I was like, 'All of that.'\u00a0I found it\u00a0resonating with me in its entirety even though we had vastly different experiences in many ways. I've never seen someone put into words all of the various facets of this experience.\"I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak.On whether Stanford has changed the conversation on rape\"I actually think the election did more to re-frame the conversation than anything else. Certainly the Access Hollywood tapes and Trump's accusers, but then also having Bill Clinton's accusers resurface. I think it brought up a lot of important questions around what we as a society find forgivable, what we'll tolerate,\u00a0and how far we still have to go if we're willing to elect someone as our leader who openly bragged about assaulting women.\"\u00a0\"I found so much power putting my own story out there,\" Danielle Beavers said.\u00a0(Photo: Danielle Beavers)Danielle Beavers had spoken about her own rape before, but after the Stanford case she wrote about it for the first time in for the Greenlining Institute\u00a0\u2014\u00a0an organization focused on race and economic justice issues where she is diversity and inclusion director.\"I was a young black girl raped by a group of young black men in blue collar Atlantic City,\" Beavers wrote.\u00a0Listening to the conversations about Emily Doe and Brock Turner, Beavers said she realized she was disturbed by \"the racial inequity of my rape.\"Why she spoke out\"I think a lot of it honestly was fueled by frustration. It's very obvious to me there are certain reasons why particular stories get uplifted and others don't. ... When we know this happens every single day, why was this\u00a0a story that got so much empathy and attention from people? \u00a0... I think the anonymity of Emily Doe \u2014\u00a0not having a face, or a concrete name to pin\u00a0to it\u00a0\u2014\u00a0helped\u00a0bring out that compassion from people. ... But I thought\u00a0that if this was a black girl walking around Oakland, would it even have gotten written about in the paper?\"How being a survivor of color can be different\"It was very obvious and very much\u00a0communicated to me even at 11 years old that talking about this looks bad for 'our people.'\u00a0And when I say 'our\u00a0people,'\u00a0it's\u00a0the black community and communities of color to a larger extent.\"A part of Emily Doe's letter that resonated with her\"One of the big pieces was how she was able to, for lack of a better word, forgive him. And talk about the life that she wanted for him afterwards. To be honest, I'm not in that place, and for her to be able to do that \u2014\u00a0in such a high-profile, contentious case that happened so quickly, to have that turnaround \u2014 I think everyone was in awe.\"\u00a0Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy.What's changed since writing about her rape\"I just feel a little stronger. I can tell by the way that\u00a0I carry myself. I think it's good for women to have at least a little bit of a sense of audaciousness and entitlement. And I say that because so often we have to apologize for our existence, apologize for violence that has happened to us, or silence ourselves because it makes people uncomfortable.\"Maya Weinstein lent her voice to the chorus of survivors last summer. \"It just felt like such an important moment,\" she said.\u00a0(Photo: Maya Weinstein)Maya Weinstein was raped the first semester of her freshman year at George Washington University in October\u00a02012. She began talking publicly about her rape six months later and has since written\u00a0about her story, shared it in the\u00a0documentary The Hunting Ground, and lent her voice to the conversation around Emily Doe in a piece published in Buzzfeed last year.On having her story out there\"My university told me I had to understand how difficult everything had been for my perpetrator. And I was like, 'that's absurd. He raped me. I'm a survivor.'Sometimes when\u00a0I have the opportunity to speak publicly ... I wonder if he sees this. I wonder if he sees me, and he knows that I won, actually. And I still have to deal with the trauma and all of the negative feelings and the mental health issues that come with surviving such an intimate traumatic experience. But at the same time, I'm doing something with it. It's\u00a0almost \u2014 it's a very weird feeling, but if he's watching, then he knows what I've been able to do.\"\u00a0A part of Emily Doe's letter that resonated with her\"The part that really stood out to me was when she talks\u00a0about how they both lost out.\"\u00a0Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering. Your damage was concrete\u037e stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me.On why everyone doesn't have to share their story\"In the survivor\u00a0space, especially over the past couple of years, there's almost a pressure to come forward with your story. People think they're not fully survivors until they share their story, and that's just not right.\u00a0\"What I think was valuable about this case was that we still don't know her name, we don't know what she looks like, but she found a way to get her voice out there in a way that resonates with survivors. And I\u00a0think that really helps, and should help survivors know that they can make an impact without having to feel exposed or vulnerable in a way they might not want to. It was a good way to create a dialogue\u00a0and show the power of a story.\"On whether Stanford has changed the conversation on rape\"I work a lot with teenagers and grade school kids on consent and healthy relationships and sexual assault. Last summer I ran a program at a summer camp \u2014\u00a0and bringing up these issues you never know what these kids and teens know \u2014\u00a0and they referenced the Stanford case. They knew the name Brock Turner. They knew the details. They knew why it was problem. ... It was huge. ... It was actually really powerful to see how this managed to reach all these young people.\"Weinstein said the election bringing sexual assault back into the national conversation in a different way, however, was painful.\"It wasn't even when those tapes were released. It\u00a0was election night and the next morning when the reality set in that\u00a0people were able to see past those comments. ...\u00a0It really just showed we have a huge culture issue in our society where we're able to say, 'Whatever, that's fine, I like the rest of him.'\u00a0That that isn't enough evidence of character.\"Chloe Allred reported her rape, but was told even before an investigation began that there would not be enough evidence to prosecute.  \"We are not making it a priority in our justice system to prosecute rapists,\" she said.\u00a0(Photo: Chloe Allred)Chloe Allred was raped in February of her sophomore year at Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle. She went to bed at a now former\u00a0friend's house.\"The next thing I remember was feeling hands on my body. No,\u00a0in\u00a0my body,\" she wrote last year for Stylecaster, a media site aimed at Millennial women.The first time Allred talked publicly about her rape was during her\u00a0art show,\u00a0To Be Brave: Ending Body Shame.\u00a0She made a painting about it, inspired by\u00a0photos she had taken of herself the night after the\u00a0assault. She said she felt compelled\u00a0\"to capture what had happened to me, which had felt so unreal.\"She has since\u00a0stood on stage with\u00a0Lady Gaga and 50 fellow survivors at\u00a0the 2016 Oscars\u00a0and, after the Stanford statement went viral, spoke out again.A part of Emily Doe's statement that resonated with her\"The way\u00a0she talked about\u00a0this feeling\u00a0of her own body being a stranger, of wanting to step outside of her body and herself.\" \u00a0I stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, I don\u2019t want my body anymore. I was terrified of it, I didn\u2019t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.On whether Stanford has changed the conversation on rape\"What I began to see in how that case was covered, and particularly after Emily Doe's statement was released, is that I think it kind of started to sink in more for people that he had done this really horrific thing and that even though he looks like a typical college kid, that doesn't excuse him for degrading another person ... It wasn't being shown until her writing and her direct\u00a0account came out where it's like,\u00a0OK, this is what this does to somebody. This is the aftermath of these '20 minutes of action.'\"After coming forward\"After my own assault I lost a lot of friends. I talked to members of my family who just didn't understand or who\u00a0blamed me for what happened. And that just felt really isolating, and I felt crazy. And the election was kind of like that, almost on a macro scale ...\u00a0It\u00a0wasn't even that people thought [Trump] wasn't capable of it. It's\u00a0that they just didn't care.\"\u00a0What she really wants people to know\"I'm a survivor. I\u00a0was assaulted in 2011 and now it's 2017 and it's still something I live with. I still live with the echoes of that trauma. I think a lot of people don't really realize how bad it is for survivors in America. I think they kind of think of American\u00a0as though it's this accepting and great place for women. I know I thought about it that way before I experienced the things that I did.\"\u00a0Chrissa Hardy said that when survivors connect with one another, \"It's much easier to fight back.\"\u00a0(Photo: Chrissa Hardy)Chrissa Hardy was 17 and a virgin when she was raped at a party. It was full of people she knew, people she trusted. She\u00a0did her best to forget what happened, but at 27 started to feel compelled to say the words: \"I was raped.\"She began to see more and more stories in the media about sexual assault, and\u00a0was troubled by the pattern she witnessed as each case played out: Women felt shame and fear coming forward about their sexual assaults, and the public's response when they did was to blame them.\"I remember feeling, 'That's exactly why I didn't say anything,'\" she said.\u00a0She eventually got to a place where she was able to say, \"It\u00a0wasn't just a drunken hookup. I was raped. I remember saying 'no,'\u00a0and him saying 'shhh.'\"After the Stanford case, Hardy decided to share her story publicly for the first time with an essay in Bustle.\u00a0Why she spoke out\"After the Emily Doe\u00a0statement came out, I was so touched and moved by her courage to not only say all of that, but to say it to him, in the courtroom. And I could not even imagine doing that myself and how much bravery that took. She just made me feel so much less alone. So I thought\u00a0maybe I can unburden myself by sharing my own story, and also make someone else feel less alone.\"What it felt like to write about her assault\"I write and edit for a living, but I've\u00a0never been able to write anything that fast. I\u00a0was terrified to sit down and do it, and even when I did it I had some tears and emotions while writing,\u00a0just sort of reliving the whole thing. But really it came out of me so fast, and I think I had it done within an hour. It's still the most important thing I've ever written and also the easiest thing I've ever written.\"A part of Emily Doe's statement that resonated with herMy sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to look at me, I\u2019m right here, I\u2019m okay, everything\u2019s okay, I\u2019m right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me.\"When she described the worry that she had about her sister's reaction and how she wanted to sort of protect her. ... That was probably the thing I connected with most, because I didn't want to hurt anyone else when I said the words, 'I was raped.'\u00a0I was worried about how my husband would feel. I prioritized\u00a0everyone's emotions above\u00a0my own.\"What she hopes people will understand. What she hopes will change.\u00a0\"I think everyone knows at least two or three women who have gone through something like this, and many of them are probably afraid to speak up or even admit to themselves that\u00a0it happened because it's so easy to buy into this idea that maybe if I dressed differently, maybe if I\u00a0didn't have as much to drink this wouldn't have happened to me. But that's not what it is. Rapists rape. It has nothing to do with alcohol. It has nothing to do with your clothing.I\u00a0want more people to believe when someone is\u00a0courageous enough to speak\u00a0out, because it takes a lot to do that. And there's this silly idea\u00a0that when women accuse any man with power or fame of sexual assault that they're doing it for fame themselves ... Women don't receive fame when they come forward with something like this. They are cloaked with shame, they are crippled by fear. They don't get money. They get death threats. That's what they get. Everyone single one of us has gotten that.\u00a0I didn't even name my attacker in my story, and I got death threats online, and other horrible things were said to me as well,\u00a0just because I\u00a0had the audacity to say that someone raped me however many years ago.\u00a0It takes a woman so much to admit something like this happened\u00a0to her. I want people to believe every woman who said that it did.\"\u00a0Read more:\u00a0", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-02T21:42:01Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "EPA head Scott Pruitt refused to say whether Trump believes climate change is an invented problem.", "title": "Does President Trump believe in climate change?

That\u2019s the discussions I\u2019ve had with the President. So that\u2019s been my focus.\u201dIn a highly anticipated announcement from the Rose Garden on Thursday, Trump pledged to\u00a0pull out of the\u00a0international agreement to reduce greenhouse gases because it would cost the U.S. millions of jobs \u2013\u00a0sparking\u00a0an outcry from European allies and\u00a0even\u00a0some high-profile American business leaders.While Trump said\u00a0he would be willing to renegotiate the agreement to be more \"fair\" to the U.S.,\u00a0he has been a longtime critic of climate change, including in a 2012\u00a0tweet when he called it a Chinese creation to make the U.S. less competitive.According to a\u00a0review by Vox.com, Trump\u00a0has tweeted climate change skepticism at least 115 times, even accusing\u00a0scientists of manipulating data.White House press secretary Sean Spicer also said he did not know the answer to whether Trump believes in climate change. \u201cI have not had an opportunity to have that discussion. Administrator Pruitt pointed out what the president is focused on is making sure we have clean water, clean air\u201d and the best deal for U.S. businesses, Spicer added.Spicer vowed to track down the answer\u00a0\u201cif possible.\u201dDuring his Thursday announcement on the climate pact,\u00a0Trump cited statistics from a Massachusetts Institute of Technology report in concluding that the agreement would only reduce emissions by a \u201ctiny, tiny amount.\"The report's author subsequently said that conclusion shows Trump misunderstood their findings. \"If we don't do anything, we might shoot over 5 degrees or more, and that would be catastrophic,\" said John Reilly, co-director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.Pruitt\u00a0insisted there was additional scientific research backing up Trump\u2019s claim that the accord would have a minimal impact on reducing carbon emissions \u2013 without providing examples. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have a corner on the market,\u201d he said of the MIT study. \u201cThere were many at the time\u201d and \u201cwe can provide those to you,\u201d said Pruitt.Later Pruitt was asked his own personal opinions about whether global warming is real, and he acknowledged that \u201cglobal warming is occurring\u201d and \u201chuman activity contributes to it.\u201d\u201cThe president made a very courageous decision yesterday for America,\u201d said Pruitt. \u201cWe have nothing to be apologetic about as a country,\u201d he said, stating that the U.S. has reduced its \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d to 1990 levels through innovation and technology.", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-02T21:42:01Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "You probably know your monthly bills can impact your credit.

But are you aware your credit score can affect the payment amount on a number of your monthly bills?Here are seven monthly bills with payments your credit score can determine.When you apply for a lease, your landlord might request a background check that includes your credit report. They can\u2019t run a background check without your permission, although refusing may prevent you from moving forward with the lease.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the landlord can take adverse action if they find red flags in your credit report. This action could include denying your rental application or raising your rent higher than they would charge another applicant. The good news is they are legally required to give you written notice if they take adverse action, provide you the report they used (if you request it within 60 days) and give you the chance to dispute the information.Consumers with good credit tend to qualify for much lower credit card interest rates than those with poor credit. Interest is applied to your credit card balance each month unless you pay it off in full within the monthly grace period. (You can go here to learn more about how credit card interest is calculated.) If you tend to carry a balance month to month, your poor credit could be costing you extra in interest.Your mortgage payment is also\u00a0directly affected by your credit. Mortgage lenders consider you a riskier borrower if you have a lower credit score. To hedge against that risk, they will charge you a higher interest rate.Credit scores impact the interest rate lenders offer when you apply for an auto loan. While interest rates vary between lenders, having excellent credit generally results in lower interest and a lower monthly payment. Those 0% financing offers you see on car commercials usually require excellent credit.Your credit score doesn\u2019t generally affect federal loan payments, but if you plan on financing your education through private loans, lenders can use your credit score to determine your interest rate and fees. The worse your credit, the more interest you\u2019ll pay on the loan.According to The Zebra\u2019s State of Auto Insurance Report, there\u2019s a correlation between credit and car insurance rates. On a national level, drivers with poor credit can pay more than twice as much as those with excellent credit for insurance. Some states have banned insurance providers from using credit scores to determine rates, but it\u2019s a common practice in the states that allow it.Insurance companies use credit-based insurance scores to determine what you\u2019ll pay for homeowners insurance. These scores are industry-specific and aren\u2019t exactly the same as your credit score, but they use the information in your credit report to determine your score. The same negative marks that bring down your credit score can impact your insurance score, and affect your payment.Given your credit\u2019s affect on nearly every bill in your mailbox (among other things, of course), it\u2019s important to regularly monitor your credit for errors (you can go here to learn how to dispute those), identity theft or legitimate negative items that are affecting your score.

We hope you find the site and the journalism we produce useful. We wanted to take some time to tell you a bit about ourselves.\n\nOur People\n\r\nThe Credit.com editorial team is staffed by a team of editors and reporters, each with many years of financial reporting experience. We\u2019ve worked for places like the New York Times, American Banker, Frontline, TheStreet.com, Business Insider, ABC News, NBC News, CNBC and many others. We also employ a few freelancers and more than 50 contributors (these are typically subject matter experts from the worlds of finance, academia, politics, business and elsewhere). \n\nOur Reporting\n\r\nWe take great pains to ensure that the articles, video and graphics you see on Credit.com are thoroughly reported and fact-checked. Each story is read by two separate editors, and we adhere to the highest editorial standards. We\u2019re not perfect, however, and if you see something that you think is wrong, please email us at editorial team [at] credit [dot] com, \n\r\nThe Credit.com editorial team is committed to providing our readers and viewers with sound, well-reported and understandable information designed to inform and empower. We won\u2019t tell you what to do. We will, however, do our best to explain the consequences of various actions, thereby arming you with the information you need to make decisions that are in your best interests. We also write about things relating to money and finance we think are interesting and want to share.\n\r\nIn addition to appearing on Credit.com, our articles are syndicated to dozens of other news sites. We have more than 100 partners, including MSN, ABC News, CBS News, Yahoo, Marketwatch, Scripps, Money Magazine and many others. This network operates similarly to the Associated Press or Reuters, except we focus almost exclusively on issues relating to personal finance. These are not advertorial or paid placements, rather we provide these articles to our partners in most cases for free. These relationships create more awareness of Credit.com in general and they result in more traffic to us as well.\n\nOur Business Model\n\r\nCredit.com\u2019s journalism is largely supported by an  e-commerce business model. Rather than rely on revenue from display ad impressions, Credit.com maintains a financial marketplace separate from its editorial pages. When someone navigates to those pages, and applies for a credit card, for example, Credit.com will get paid what is essentially a finder\u2019s fee if that person ends up getting the card. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that our editorial decisions are informed by the products available in our marketplace. The editorial team chooses what to write about and how to write about it independently of the decisions and priorities of the business side of the company. In fact, we maintain a strict and important firewall between the editorial and business departments. Our mission as journalists is to serve the reader, not the advertiser. In that sense, we are no different from any other news organization that is supported by ad revenue.\n\r\nVisitors to Credit.com are also able to register for a free Credit.com account, which gives them access to a tool called The Credit Report Card. This tool provides users with two free credit scores and a breakdown of the information in their Experian credit report, updated twice monthly. Again, this tool is entirely free, and we mention that frequently in our articles, because we think that it\u2019s a good thing for users to have access to data like this. Separate from its educational value, there is also a business angle to the Credit Report Card. Registered users can be matched with products and services for which they are most likely to qualify. In other words, if you register and you find that your credit is less than stellar, Credit.com won\u2019t recommend a high-end platinum credit card that requires an excellent credit score You\u2019d likely get rejected, and that\u2019s no good for you or Credit.com. You\u2019d be no closer to getting a product you need, there\u2019d be a wasted inquiry on your credit report, and Credit.com wouldn\u2019t get paid. These are essentially what are commonly referred to as \"targeted ads\" in the world of the Internet. Despite all of this, however, even if you never apply for any product, the Credit Report Card will remain free, and none of this will impact how the editorial team reports on credit and credit scores.\n\nOur Owners\n\r\nCredit.com is owned by Progrexion Holdings Inc. which is the owner and administrator of a number of business related to credit and credit repair, including CreditRepair.com, and eFolks. In addition, Progrexion also provides services to Lexington Law Firm as a third party provider.

Richard Burr speaks to the media in Washington on May 25, 2017.\u00a0(Photo: Tasos Katopodis, European Pressphoto Agency)WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Richard Burr doesn't envision the Senate passing legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare this year and is skeptical about the chances of it getting done at all.\"It's unlikely that we will get a health care deal,\"\u00a0the North Carolina Republican told WXII 12 News\u00a0Thursday.\u00a0He added that his focus would be on states, like Iowa, that were losing their insurance companies based on the current health care market.\"I don\u2019t see a comprehensive health care plan this year,\" he added.Republicans in the Senate have a slim 52-48 majority and can only lose two votes if they want legislation to pass. No Democrats are expected to vote to dismantle former president Barack Obama's signature health care bill.A handful of Senate Republicans have been huddling weekly to try to hash out details of the plan. So far, these conversations have not produced any policy details but have acted as broad discussions of what members would like to see in the bill.House Republicans passed their version of a bill in May, but many\u00a0Republicans \u2014 including Burr \u2014 have dismissed it as a \"dead on arrival\" in the Senate. That bill allows states to apply to waive mandates that insurance companies cover certain types of care, like maternity care and substance abuse. It also allows insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions more, although there is money set aside with the goal of mitigating the high costs.", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-02T21:42:02Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "Authorities, on alert after the Manchester bombing, report 'concrete evidence' of a threat.", "title": "German rock festival evacuated over terror threat", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/02/german-rock-festival-evacuated-over-terror-threat/102433832/", "numberOfLinks": 4, "author": "Doug Stanglin", "publishedAt": "2017-06-02T20:55:02Z", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0affd7472962c9cba5a98780c5f95388bef402c0/c=0-158-4800-2870&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/06/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636320173255473934-EPA-GERMANY-ROCK-AM-RING.jpg", "article": "Police\u00a0evacuated some 80,000 people at a\u00a0three-day rock festival in far west\u00a0Germany late Friday because of \"concrete evidence\" of a possible terrorist threat, authorities\u00a0said.Festivalgoers were instructed to leave the Nuerburgring arena outside Nuerburg\u00a0and go to nearby camping sites, according to organizers of the event,\u00a0called Rock-am-Ring.

And luckily for him, the justices may prove to be the most receptive audience to his lawyers' arguments.Federal judges in Hawaii, Washington, California, Maryland, Massachusetts and Virginia have ruled that two versions of his ban, issued Jan. 27 and March 6,\u00a0violate\u00a0First Amendment protections of religion. They all concluded that Trump's national security justification\u00a0for the ban was far outweighed by a\u00a0clear intent to discriminate against Muslims.Now Department of Justice lawyers, armed with a series of dissenting opinions from those lower courts, will plead their case before a more conservative court, with the prospect that a majority of justices may embrace their arguments.In a court filing Thursday, the department\u00a0argued that a candidate's statements on the campaign trail \u2014 in this case, Trump's call for a \"Muslim\" ban\u00a0\u2014\u00a0should not be considered when reviewing a president's actions. And they argued that judicial rulings have long held that presidents are to be trusted when they say they are acting to protect\u00a0national security.\"There's this long line of immigration law, of precedence at the Supreme Court, that are premised on that kind of reasoning,\" said Peter Spiro, a professor at the Temple University Beasley School of Law. \"If they want to uphold the ban, the opinion writes itself.\"At issue is Trump's plan to temporarily ban most travel from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen\u00a0for 90 days\u00a0and suspend the entire refugee program for 120 days so the government can improve screening procedures to make sure terrorists don't slip into the country.Here is a look at some of the issues the high court will grapple with:One central question\u00a0is whether a court is allowed to try and figure out the intent behind a presidential\u00a0order.During his\u00a0campaign, Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" Opponents of the ban believe that statement, combined with others made by Trump\u00a0and aides\u00a0before and after he became president, is proof that the ban was nothing more than a \"Muslim ban.\"But is it the role of a court to conduct that kind of analysis?\u00a0Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall has argued that courts cannot \"psychoanalyze\" Trump's motivations. If the text of an order is legal, Wall says, courts are not allowed to \"look behind\" that text to determine intent.The Department of Justice has pointed to a Supreme Court opinion in Kleindienst v Mandel, a 1972 ruling that found courts cannot \"look behind\" an act performed by a government employee if there is a \"facially legitimate and bona fide reason\" for the act.Five judges from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco penned a dissent opinion asking how the majority could ignore that precedent when reaching its ruling to maintain a hold against Trump's first travel ban.\"Even if we have questions about the basis for the President\u2019s ultimate findings \u2014 whether it was a \"Muslim ban\" or something else \u2014 we do not get to peek behind the curtain,\" Judge Jay Bybee, who was appointed to the 9th Circuit by President George W. Bush, wrote for the minority. \"So long as there is one 'facially legitimate and bona fide'\u00a0reason for the President\u2019s actions, our inquiry is at an end.\"Read more:While candidate Trump called for a \"Muslim\" ban during his campaign, Justice lawyers argue that he never advocated such a ban as president.Instead, they say Trump's approach to the issue evolved to the point where he focused on the national security threats from specific territories, not on people's religion. That's why he selected specific countries to ban, not every country where Muslims are predominant, they say.The first travel ban included a section that gave preference to religious minorities, a provision that Trump said was designed to help persecuted Christians living in the targeted countries. But that section was removed from the revised travel order, which Wall said should settle any doubts about the national security impetus behind the ban.\"The debate over the meaning of the President\u2019s\u00a0statements only highlights the dangers in 'opening\u00a0the door'\u00a0to campaign comments,\" Wall wrote this week.Christopher Hajec, director of litigation at the Immigration Reform Law Institute, which has filed briefs supporting the travel ban, said he was shocked to hear liberal judges openly scrutinizing the national security justification outlined in Trump's executive order.\"Courts are totally unequipped to do that,\" Hajec said. \"It's totally out of bounds. I don't think the majority of the Supreme Court is going to make that same mistake.\"Several judges who struck down the travel ban argued that the administration did not provide a sufficient national security justification to bar 180 million people from entering the U.S.Judge Barbara Milano Keenan, who was appointed to\u00a0the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit by President Barack Obama, wrote that Trump's order outlines broad conditions of lawlessness in the six targeted countries, and describes each of them as terrorist safe havens. But Keenan wrote that the government never clearly established a link between conditions in those countries and its residents' likelihood of becoming terrorists.For supporters of Trump's travel ban, Keenan and other judges were overstepping their authority by even debating the president's national security argument. Wall repeatedly said during oral arguments that no court has ever scrutinized national security arguments made by a sitting president.U.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga in Alexandria, Va., provided one of the only victories for Trump when he upheld the travel ban in March. Trenga, who was appointed by George W. Bush, wrote that other courts around him were ignoring the fact that the administration made significant changes to the second travel ban to augment its national security justification.Responding to court rulings against the first ban, the revised ban included a country-by-country outline of conditions on the ground\u00a0and ties to terrorist organizations. The end result, Trenga argued, was a\u00a0\"detailed justification for the Order based on national security needs.\"Judge Dennis Shedd, who was appointed to the 4th Circuit by\u00a0President George H. W. Bush, went further, pointing to statements by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Department of Homeland Security Director John Kelly, who argued that the order was needed for national security.\"Shouldn't that be considered?\" Shedd asked during oral arguments in May.Contributing: Richard Wolf in Washington, D.C.", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-02T21:42:02Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "In an emotional statement, comedian Kathy Griffin says she thinks President Trump 'broke her.'", "title": "Kathy Griffin about Donald Trump: 'He broke me'", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/politics/2017/06/02/kathy-griffin-donald-trump-he-broke-me/102436218/", "numberOfLinks": 1, "author": "USA TODAY", "publishedAt": "2017-06-02T21:07:01+00:00", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8053d91dc9a2258a0283ca7a3f06eb1e3cc2b513/r=x1803&c=3200x1800/https/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201706/579/29906170001_5457997427001_5457962191001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "article": "", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-02T21:42:03Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "View videos and photo galleries from USA TODAY", "title": "Griffin not &#39;laying down&#39; for Trump, fears career is over", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2017/06/02/griffin-not-&#39;laying-down&#39;-trump,-fears-career-over/102435916/", "numberOfLinks": 0, "author": null, "publishedAt": null, "urlToImage": null, "article": "", "dateOfCollection": "2017-06-02T21:42:03Z"}, {"publisher": "usa-today", "media_urls": "", "labels": ["credible_urls"], "description": "It's Pride month and all over the United States LGBT advocates are celebrating advances and equality.", "title": "Some of America's best gay Pride celebrations", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/06/02/some-americas-best-gay-pride-celebrations/365127001/", "numberOfLinks": 22, "author": "Sean Rossman", "publishedAt": "2017-06-03T00:56:55+00:00", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/21105e901733baae802bab06d229d24c3fcd4da4/c=0-449-1992-1575&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/04/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636269350988274757-gay-pride-6.jpg", "article": "Nearly 50 years since\u00a0New York City police officers raided the Stonewall Inn, gay Pride celebrations are seemingly everywhere in the United States, from small Southern towns, to Midwest cities and teeming metropolises.These vibrant displays of gay culture are\u00a0now firmly part of American culture, despite a barrage of new anti-LGBT bills in more than half the states.\u00a0This year's Pride events, like most of 2017,\u00a0come with a tint of President Trump.
